      <para>Humanity is undergoing a species level rite of passage. We can
      choose to disagree on how to address the problems of climate change,
      cascading ecosystems collapse, obscene levels of inequality, etc., or we
      can manifest our evolutionary potential and mature into new ways of
      collaboration for the common good of people and planet. This will happen
      place by place, community by community, bioregion by bioregion. It
      requires paying attention to the biocultural uniqueness of places and
      people. We are capable of moving from a culturally dominant story of
      competitive scarcity to co-creating a world of collaborative abundance
      and in the process heal the Earth and her people. In order to do so we
      need to work on inclusion, participation and collaborative decision
      making. Sociocracy offers effective ways to accomplish just that. Ted
      Rau’s book makes its practice and processes easy to understand and apply
      for any group ready to step into the adventure of co-creating diverse
      regenerative cultures everywhere.</para>

      second, this book will be a required resource the next time I’m in such
      a position without Ted there! Read, enjoy, emerge, decide!</para>

      really want to cooperate and collaborate but need better tools. A

      <para>How does one start a completely self-governed group? Ted Rau is
      one of the most appropriate people to answer this question, because it
      is something he works on every day, not only in the organization of
      which he is the operational leader and co-founder, Sociocracy For All,
      but also accompanying groups and organizations (for profit and
      non-profit) that seek self-management and sharing of power. For those of
      us who work with him, he is a constant guide and reference due to his
      great knowledge, multiple experiences and the ability to explain things
      with clear, simple and with replicable materials. This book brings great
      clarity to those who accompany groups and who are part of them, since
      there are always common situations. Here, we will find concrete ways to
      be able to navigate and overcome them.</para>

    <blockquote>
      <attribution>Paul Atkins, Prosocial.world</attribution>

      <para>What I love about Ted’s writing is that he speaks from the heart
      and from experience. Everything Ted discusses in this book he has tried
      and tested; and everything works! Our world seems to be moving through a
      phase of increasing division and rampant self-interest. Forming small
      groups that embody cultures of caring, empathy and ‘power-with’ rather
      than ‘power-over’ is a way for each of us to practice the skills that
      the world needs to move toward greater harmony. Well functioning small
      groups are a powerful piece of the more networked world we are creating.
      Ted is a gift to the world, and this book is a fantastic, practical
      guide to creating groups with the culture we need.</para>

      <title>Why this book?</title>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Can
      you launch a new group in 3 meetings and establish shared power and
      self-management? I think you can, if, in those three meetings, you
      define the purpose well and put the needed infrastructure and practices
      in place. This booklet shows in detail how to do that.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Any
      organization will have a particular DNA – power relationships,
      practices, ideas – as it starts, and that very DNA is tough to change
      retroactively. The best idea is to start on the right foot at the very
      beginning.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Any
      group can form itself using the template outlined in this book. It works
      especially well if the founders and early members want to grow and
      nourish an organization that gives every member a voice and that is
      effective. Why those two, voice and effectiveness? Because that’s what
      makes an organization. An organization is an organized body of people
      with a shared purpose. So what matters in an organization is the people,
      the purpose, and how we organize it.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->If
      you are part of a group that has already formed but has struggled to get
      off the ground – in particular, if people are arguing over how to decide
      who decides what – you might be able to re-launch your group using this
      book.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Many
      areas of our societies need change. The issues humanity is facing are
      too many to list in all of our sectors: environment and climate,
      education, economy, health, and well-being. The agency of one
      individual, no matter how powerful, is limited. The only way to change
      anything is to change things on a systemic level, which requires the
      cooperation of people, groups of people, and groups of groups of
      people!</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->So
      many groups form. And so many groups fade. What distinguishes those
      groups that grow and flourish from those that fade and fail? The success
      factors are well-studied, even though the lessons learned hardly make it
      into the design of those who start groups. That makes sense – groups
      form because people feel the urgency for change in an area of their
      attention, not because they are experts in how to start a group.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Someone
      who wants to start a school might be an expert in teaching, not in
      starting organizations. Yet, much about starting a school is unique to
      <emphasis role="from-text">starting an organization</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->,
      not pedagogy. Am I saying that only “experts” should start groups or
      that every new group should have a consultant to help? Not at all! Quite
      the opposite. I intend to give everyone just enough guidance to start
      groups that get off on the right foot. That way, everyone can focus on
      their strengths and expertise, may it be pedagogy, coding, gardening,
      writing, forming a community, or making things. My dream is to bring the
      skill of self-governance into every corner of society.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->In
      writing this book, I am making the assumption that we start a group
      aligned with the principles of sociocracy, also known as Dynamic
      Governance. Sociocracy is a governance system born in the late 1970s in
      the Netherlands. It has not yet become the “new normal,” and it is still
      relatively uncommon in mainstream organizing. However, this is changing
      quickly right now!</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Sociocracy
      combines the roots of consensus decision-making from the Quakers with
      insights from natural systems and cybernetics, forming a robust and
      simultaneously flexible system that is extremely adaptable to any
      organization. It builds on consent as decision-making, a way to make
      decisions without coercion. It also builds on small groups of <!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->“human<!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
      scale”. Sociocracy has a strong focus on increasing the flow of
      information and connection – the elixir that makes us understand each
      other.</para>

      if we work in a decentralized, flexible, and deeply respectful way can
      we address our realities’ complexities. And more and more people see
      that.</para>

      <title><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#46818D" font="sansserif" -->Who:
      new groups and early ‘make-overs’</title>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->I
      wrote this book for everyone who deeply cares about a cause, and about
      collaboration as peers. Your cause might be the environment, equality,
      education. You might want to start learning pods, you might want to buy
      a store with others, or you might want to organize an online conference.
      Whatever your cause – if you are founding a group, this book will help
      you to set it up.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->If
      you are part of a group that started a while ago and has been
      floundering, you can use this book to “re-launch” the group in a
      make-over with more clarity. For example, when I gave a copy of this
      book to a dear friend of mine who worked for a nonprofit organization of
      five staff that had been around for two years, he said, “Can I share
      this with my team? I think we still need to go through this process to
      understand how we’re setting things up.”</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->So
      if you’re in this “operational but somehow not quite clear who decides”
      stage, you can use this book to give yourself a re-boot. However, you
      can only use the process in this book if the number of people actively
      involved in decisions or operations is ten people or less. If there are
      more than ten or twelve people involved already, and you do not know who
      decides and how, then this process will <emphasis
      role="from-text">not</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
      be right for you. Note: if there are more people <emphasis
      role="from-text">tangentially</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
      involved, it might still work. What matters here are the people who are
      under the impression that they are decision-makers and players in the
      group.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Why
      would anyone do anything else? Without sociocracy, we will spend hours
      re-inventing governance, or we might re-invent top-down organizing.
      Without a purpose, we might disappoint each other or waste our time, and
      why do anything if it’s not meaningful? Spending time with people I
      enjoy is a big motivator. With all the different directions we find
      ourselves pulled towards, connection is what adds the magic
      sauce.</para>

      bit more about me: Born and raised in Germany, I hold a Ph.D. in
      linguistics (I wrote about on the interface of syntax and semantics). I
      live in an intentional community in Massachusetts that runs
      sociocratically. I am transgender and parent of 5 queer kids. I write
      music.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->I
      enjoy where I am right now. I am content doing something that I am good
      at in an organization where I can be of service, together with
      mission-aligned people, for something that is needed and that is in
      increasing demand: supporting effective and egalitarian
      governance.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Born
      in 1979, I was born into a generation that was still processing the
      collective experience and traumas of fascism. I realized around the age
      of 13 that if so many people in a society can be so out of integrity, I
      myself couldn’t be sure that I would do anything differently had I been
      in their situation. The mercy of having been born later was very real to
      me. I was able to grow up ‘non-guilty’ (at least of injustices of the
      past) only because I was born into a time when I didn’t have to make
      those choices. It was then, as a young teenager, that I understood that
      systems are more potent than good intentions. In order to be who we want
      to be, we need systems around us that <emphasis
      role="from-text">support</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
      our integrity, best intentions and allow for us to act accordingly.
      That’s what governance is.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->To
      get tuned into that early stage of an organization, let me tell you
      stories about organizations that <emphasis
      role="from-text">didn’t</emphasis> make it.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->I
      was talking in a Zoom call with two members of a group in Michigan. They
      had been part of an initiative for about two years that wanted to
      combine farming and living together. The handful of founding members had
      welcomed new members with open arms, and the “family” grew and grew.
      They decided things together. The group members deeply loved and
      respected each other – that was palpable even for me in listening to
      their story.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Over
      time, the more people joined, the harder and harder it got to hear
      everyone, despite everyone’s friendship and best intentions. It was
      simply too many people. It became obscure who knew what, who wanted what
      for what reason, and who was doing what. It was nobody’s fault; it was
      just a matter of bandwidth. As a result, decisions were slowed down.
      People weren’t able to track each other’s needs as well anymore. Little
      things were dropped here and there. And it was just a matter of time
      until some people started to interpret malicious intent into that
      unanswered email, that forgotten agenda item, that phone call that was
      never returned, that slightly misrepresented report. Tensions grew, and
      all of a sudden, love was not the answer to everything anymore. A system
      was needed. That’s when they contacted me. But that didn’t diminish the
      chaos. In that phone call, they told me this: “We all agree that we want
      to hire you to help us with our decision-making. But we don’t know how
      to decide who decides to hire you.” I never heard from them
      again.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->The
      catch-22 nature of the problem made me squirm. They knew what I knew:
      that there was hardly any hope. Note again that everyone had the best
      intentions. The complexity of their problem had outgrown them. It was a
      checkmate kind of situation. I don’t know how their story ended but
      having seen many similar stories, it is easy to imagine what happens
      next. Some people leave, in particular, those who want to help make
      things happen. Some people stay because they like the people or simply
      don’t have a similar project in their lives that fills the gap. No new
      members join because everyone can easily sense that this organization is
      in trouble. It will fade away and die.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->I
      find these situations disheartening. It is baffling that good intentions
      and affection don’t seem to be enough to hold an organization together
      through growth. I wish it would, but evidence shows me that it simply is
      not true. An organization brings a level of complexity and dynamic that
      most of us are not prepared for. And that way, we walk into a trap – at
      least if we prefer to work in non-hierarchical ways.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->That
      group could have been a growing family business, a nonprofit, an
      activist group, a consulting firm – the dynamics are just what happens,
      like a play where all the roles are already set. It is pre-scripted
      because everyone does what makes sense in their position. The dynamics
      at play are bigger than what any one individual can change.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->In
      some organizations, things play out differently. They slide down the
      slippery slope of ‘more order means more hierarchy.’ Let’s look at an

      group of activists is forming a consumer co-op. Five families start
      buying almonds and tropical fruit together. They are well organized.
      Other families join in, and the group grows. Every other Saturday is
      busy now, sorting and packing and delivering. There’s bookkeeping to do,
      and there are emails to send. Now those five families hold regular jobs,
      and some of them have children. They love their project, and they are
      proud of how successful and attractive it is as operations get more and
      more draining – a ‘problem’ of success. One group member happens to lose
      their day job, and they finally decide that she could be in charge of
      leading operations. The project manager is now paid, and as she gets
      overloaded, more people get hired, starting with a bookkeeper. What
      started as a group of equals turns into a hierarchical organization like
      any other. After all, what other way was there, given that things needed
      to get taken care of? Five years later, some of the original members
      might still be around. But over time, the organization hardly even
      resembles what they so dearly cared for in the beginning.</para>

      ownership structure early. But in the end, even big cooperatives very

      day-to-day operations looks the same.)</para>

      story. It was a group of people doing good work to create more local
      connections and infrastructure. Everyone was experienced, dedicated, and
      interested in the best for the group. Because everyone trusted each
      other, it seemed like not a lot of structure was needed. Similar to the
      first story, they ran on good intentions. So far, this group very much
      resembles the first story, but there is one big difference. One of them,
      Brian, was the founder. A charismatic and peer-oriented leader, he had
      gathered his friends around this project, who then brought friends. But
      in the group’s origin story, it was clear that this was “Brian’s group”
      because of the effort and care he put into the project. Brian knew about
      sociocracy and knew that he wanted to give the project structure. He
      announced there would be teams (aka circles), and a lot of energy came
      from that. Yet, he wanted the group to have a say on the circle
      structure, which created a slowdown because it was hard to wrangle the
      group into giving feedback on the proposed structure. I am not quite
      sure what happened next. Maybe there were some hurt feelings. Something
      was said that wasn’t received the way it had been intended. The next
      time Brian and I talked, resistance had started to form. People were
      demanding a say in what the structure would be and that Brian would not
      be the one who decides about the structure. But unfortunately, there was
      no structure in which to decide whether Brian could decide. Brian’s
      proposal for a circle structure was met with rebellion. The group fell
      apart. I was shocked. In my view, Brian had done everything right. He
      saw the need for structure, and he made sure to implement it. He had
      asked for feedback. He was respected and experienced and not at all a
      power-grab kind of person. Quite the opposite! He had worked so hard to
      develop a suitable structure to distribute power because he had no
      interest in holding power. But he had waited too long. The group did not
      see that the only way to have power was to receive and accept it from
      the willing founder. The whole project withered away within
      weeks.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->A
      lesson we can learn from this story is that <emphasis
      role="bold">leadership is needed to distribute power.</emphasis> Another
      national organization suffered the same dynamics, with an intense level
      of pain and suffering for everyone involved. The centralized
      organization leaders were not willing to distribute power, but they were
      also not holding it. Their excuse: “We’re not holding on to power, quite
      on the contrary! There are so many decisions we didn’t make that there’s
      plenty of room for groups to step up.” Yet, of course, that’s not how
      groups step up. Distribution of power does not come from leaving a
      vacuum or letting things fall how they fall. Distributing power is an
      active process that requires listening, alignment, and skill. And that’s
      what this book is about.</para>

      <title>The question of legitimacy</title>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Legitimacy
      is a sticky concept, especially in self-governance. If a group wants to
      self-govern, who decides that it will, and how?</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->In
      some models, it is the founder, or the owner of a company that puts the
      constitution in place to “make everyone equal under the constitution.”
      Yet, could the person who puts it into place also take it away, like a
      parliament that operates at the mercy of a king?</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Real
      self-governance is by the people and for the people. It is not put in
      place by anyone except the collective – otherwise, it could be taken
      away again.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->A
      group of people needs to give itself a governance system, and the group
      needs to own and approve the governance system itself. Yet, there’s a
      severe chicken-egg issue here – how can we take an unordered group of
      people and get them to follow a process to accept an orderly governance
      system?</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Don’t
      get me wrong – some groups manage. Yet, retrofitting an organization
      requires training, reflection, and conversation to collectively come to
      the insight that it’s necessary and desirable to make the switch
      together. If just one person – in a consensus model – or one person with
      absolute power – in a hierarchical model – says no, then the way to
      self-governance is blocked.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->So
      while retrofitting an organization with a collective organizing effort
      is possible, it’s a bit of a gamble. That’s why this booklet is taking
      an alternative approach. The idea is not to disregard those efforts –
      transforming organizations is still useful. But the more promising
      approach is this: can we plant the seed in a way so we can avoid all of
      these issues altogether? How does one <emphasis
      role="from-text">start</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
      an entirely self-governed group?</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->A
      sociocratic organization holds a balance between all the different
      bodies – the circle members are balanced through consent. No one circle
      member can overpower another. The same is true for two circles in
      relation to each other – as we will see, linking and consent as well as
      aims (that are decided by consent) keep the balance between circles. No
      circle can ever overpower another circle.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Yet,
      if there is no organization yet, who decides who can join?</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->The
      question of where to start is a bit like asking, “how do you get two
      people onto a see-saw when they can’t both get on at the same time?”
      Ultimately, one side might start and then let the other side get on.
      That’s when the game begins. Alternatively, both can agree to hold the
      see-saw and coordinate to get on simultaneously. Both paths are combined
      in this book. The group of founders gets on together, creating balance
      for future members.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->If
      there is one initial “creator” of the organization, then the legitimacy
      comes from there. That might happen if, for example, a grant giver calls
      an organization into existence, if an organization forms a spin-off or
      if a respected and quick-acting founder puts an organization in place
      and withdraws from the operations. Brian from the previous story could
      have created this scenario had he acted earlier and had it been clear
      that he will not interfere with the organization operationally. The
      chicken-egg issues around legitimacy don’t tend to arise when that
      happens. People will accept that the organization has been formed that
      way and hopefully never question its origin.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->However,
      the second scenario – a working group forming by itself – is much more
      frequent and is much more likely to stir up questions. It’s the
      cooperatives, start-ups, activist groups, and all worker- or member-run
      initiatives that run into the legitimacy issues. It’s almost impossible
      to create balance once everyone is already on the see-saw, plus there
      will always be battles over who got on first. This booklet focuses on
      those scenarios and shows to start without breeding resentment or
      raising suspicion.</para>

    <title><emphasis role="bold">Invitation to the 1st
    meeting</emphasis></title>

    <para>In my ideal fantasy, you have a cause, and you’re ready to invite
    others to form a group. You are about to send a message to a group of
    people inviting them to a first meeting. What do you write?</para>

    <para>The most important part of this invitation is to set an expectation
    that is accurate and helpful. There is one thing you absolutely need to
    say: <emphasis role="bold">What the proposed aim of the group
    is.</emphasis></para>

    <section>
      <title>Must-have: the proposed aim</title>

      <para>The aim has to be specific, to give people a clear idea of what
      project you are inviting them to. Let’s say, for example, you want to
      form a climate group. You send an email to all your friends who care
      about the climate and invite them to the first meeting. Now you have ten
      people in the room. One of them has worked in climate research for 15
      years and loves to geek out about statistics. Another cares more about
      biodiversity than climate. (Of course, the topics are related but
      still.) Yet another just recently caught on after their first child was
      born. They started to think, “as the child grows, how will climate
      change disrupt the world?” They aren’t really interested in science but
      more in implications for their kids and climate education. Imagine their
      conversation - what common ground will they have?</para>

      <para>You get the idea – ‘climate group’ is too big of a container. Your
      invitation was too broad.</para>

      <para>Let’s imagine you are throwing a party. You would never say, “I am
      inviting you to a party next week! See you then!” People would have no
      idea how to join your party, and that’s what happens if the aim is too
      broad. A proper invite is specific, and if you’re planning something
      particular, you should say so. For example, tell people if it’s a
      costume party or a formal dress party. Tell them if it’s a birthday
      party or a surprise party for your partner. People can choose to come or
      not – but not setting the terms is doing everyone a disservice. You
      don’t get the party you wanted, and guests will be uncomfortable. A good
      host sets the stage so people feel comfortable and welcome. That’s your
      job if you start a group.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Another
      factor is to manage the expectations: some groups are action-oriented,
      some are more for mutual support or learning. A climate group might be
      planning actions or talking about how to lobby or start a local chapter
      of a national climate organization. You might just want to grieve
      together and not “build” anything. Then grieving together is your aim.
      (Of course, any group’s purpose might change over time, but then that’s
      a decision that is made together and explicit.)</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->A
      specific invitation might sound like this: <emphasis role="from-text">I
      want to form a local chapter of the XY movement focusing on local
      activities that raise awareness about the climate and loss of
      biodiversity.</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" --></para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->The
      aim needs to describe what people will see you do when you are working
      on your project. Another way to describe it is, what’s your product or
      your service?</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Not
      setting a clear aim is the biggest mistake one can make. Once the group
      has bonded, people will have a hard time leaving it again – there is
      always inertia around leaving a group, and people feel bad when they do.
      Ultimately, without a defined aim, the group will spend months trying to
      determine its aim. At least one-third of the people will have joined
      with different expectations and will get more and more disappointed over
      time. The group might split. There will likely be hard feelings.
      Starting with an unclear aim is not worth it.</para>

      </informalfigure>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Can’t
      the group decide the aim together? Probably – but it requires skill and
      focus. And what do you do if you have people in the room that did show
      up with other expectations? Only leave the aim up to the group if you
      are willing to tell people: sorry, it looks like we have three different
      sets of expectations here. Let’s split the group. I think that it’s too
      risky to gamble with people’s time and hopes.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Ultimately,
      any action means focus, which will mean letting go of some alternative
      project one <emphasis role="from-text">could</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
      have pursued. If that is hard for you, this might help: there is space
      in the world for many wonderful opportunities. Not all of them will
      happen with me, that’s for sure! So if you have to say <emphasis
      role="from-text">no</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
      to project C in order to focus on projects A and B, just remember that
      you can wholeheartedly wish project C all the best. By choosing projects
      A and B, you are not saying that project C <emphasis
      role="from-text">isn’t</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
      worth doing. All you are saying is that you will do projects A and B. It
      is not a rejection – even though it might feel like one. Project C will
      flourish once it finds its place. Just trust that it will.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->A
        check-in is simple: do one round where everyone shares how they are
        doing entering the meeting. It can be simple and non-dramatic, “I am
        ok, a bit short on sleep. I had a meeting earlier that went pretty
        well, and I’m excited to be here and see what’s going to
        happen.”</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->If
        people know each other well, they might start sharing more vulnerably,
        which is connecting. (It might make sense to let those go first who
        have experience with check-ins.)</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->If
        people don’t know each other at all, at this first meeting, ask people
        to say a bit about their background. They can share whatever might be
        relevant to the topic of your meeting. (Also announce that there will
        be a chance to share more about the personal experience, so it’s ok to
        keep it brief for now.)</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->One
        comment that might be more of a personal preference of mine: I find
        check-ins the most relaxing and welcoming when the facilitator calls
        on people one by one and does so in a round, so it’s obvious who will
        speak when.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Why
        not let people volunteer and speak at will until everyone has spoken?
        Or ask one person to go first and then have them name the next person?
        Well, here’s how those formats land on me. In the first variant, I get
        so worried to awkwardly interrupt someone that it makes it hard for me
        to speak at all. In the second, I fear that moment of embarrassment
        when I name someone to go after me who has already spoken. That’s why
        I save my guests the trouble and simply call on everybody one by one.
        Everyone will get to speak, and everyone will feel more comfortable
        when safely held.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Consent to agenda</title>

        <para>The agenda in a sociocratic meeting is decided by consent. In my
        view, this is an innocent-looking step with huge importance. Please do
        not gloss over it or skip it.</para>

        <para>How it’s done: present the agenda with enough detail so people
        understand and form an informed opinion on whether the agenda will
        serve the group’s purpose. Encourage people to ask questions – show
        that you care whether they understand. Then ask whether they see any
        reason to change the agenda or whether it is good enough to get
        started. If no one speaks up, you’ve now made your first consent
        decision as a group.</para>

        <para>Why is this so important? Because the agenda is the agreement of
        how we spend our time together. That is a decision we make together.
        That means that everyone in the group is co-responsible for sticking
        to their own agreement. If later, for example, one person talks for 10
        minutes at a time repeatedly and causes the agenda to run over, and
        that every person has consented to the original agreement, you now
        have something to hold them accountable to by reminding them that an
        agreement was made.</para>

        <para>Consenting to the agenda together is crucial because you are not
        forcing an agenda onto the group. You are proposing, and the group is
        actively embracing it. Remember the see-saw? It’s a bit like all your
        guests are standing around the see-saw, and you are asking for
        permission from everyone so you could hold it in place for a moment so
        we can all put the first foot onto the see-saw. And this is where it
        all begins.</para>

      will discuss these topics in more depth later in this chapter, but I’d
      like to show how these topics follow a natural progression. (You are, of
      course, free to change the order of agenda items or to put some agenda
      items off until the next meeting.) Here are my thoughts on why these

            role="bold">rounds</emphasis> are a great way to keep discussions
            flowing and orderly and inclusive. So before we can talk and make
            decisions, we need to establish how we do that. If you don’t, your
            fate will most likely be like the organizations’ in the section of

      <title>Committing to consent</title>

      <para>A group that can’t decide how to decide will struggle. It’s a bit
      like you can’t discuss what language you are going to speak without
      speaking in a language. It’s circular, and that circle can easily be a
      death spiral.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->There
      are a lot of decision-making methods. For example, you can vote by
      majority vote, but that would mean you’d have to be ok with ignoring 49%
      of the voices. You could use consensus (which will be very similar to
      consent), but it may set you up for lengthy discussions and might put
      the group at the mercy of individuals who block decisions.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Someone
      in your group might have heard about the advice process: that’s when we
      empower individuals to make decisions after consulting with others.
      That’s a great way to do things and very compatible with sociocracy.
      Yet, it’s a secondary method of decision-making because it requires that
      we already made the decision somehow to empower that individual so that
      particular individual can decide. So that will be added later. For now,
      we are looking for a way our group can decide, not for a way how
      individuals can decide.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Consent</title>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Consent
        is a decision-making method where a proposal is approved if no one in
        the group sees a reason to object. A reason to object would be that
        the proposal harms the aim of the group. If someone sees a reason, we
        work as a group to see if we can tweak the proposal until it does
        work. To approve a proposal, 100% of all group members need to
        consent.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Note
        that they don’t have to love the proposal to consent. It’s ok when the

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->When

        the following story. You are welcome to borrow my story or find your
        own story:</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->I
        have five children, and they are all very different from each other.
        They like different things, and they dislike different things. Let’s
        say I want to decide what to have for lunch. If I ask them, “what do
        you want for lunch?” then I lost already. There is absolutely no way
        these five individuals will ever want the same thing. And just by
        asking what they want, I have already set myself up for failure
        because they now assume that they can always get what they
        want.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Instead,
        I need to ask for ideas for lunch. Out of those ideas, I pick
        something and propose it. Let’s say I want to propose burritos. The
        question I need to ask then is <emphasis
        role="from-text">not</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->:
        “Do you want burritos for lunch?” The question is: “Is there any
        reason <emphasis role="from-text">not</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
        to have burritos for lunch?”</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->That
        way, now the family member that has a reason not to eat burritos will
        be able to say so. But if one child really wanted noodles but is
        willing to go for burritos, we can still make a decision. I’ve set the
        expectation to what people are willing to do, not what they want to
        do.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->(While
        this is an example that clicks well with people, family
        decision-making is tricky because families lack a clear and explicitly
        stated aim. Is the aim to spend time together or to support each other
        in a healthy way? I guess it’s something like that, but it is
        different from an organization we join out of choice around the aim.
        Yet, it sure was quite a memorable moment when I realized that. It was
        on Main Street in the town where I live, about half-way between the
        pizza place and the burrito place, with two kids in a full-blown
        tantrum, and I swore to myself never to make that mistake
        again.)</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Consent
        keeps things moving. If someone objects, the objections point out
        exactly what issue we need to focus on to improve the proposal. For
        example, let’s say burritos are more expensive than pizza and the
        paying parent objects. Can we make a deal of getting the least
        expensive order? Or let’s say one of the kids doesn’t like spicy food.
        Can we order a non-spicy version? Objections are welcome to improve
        the proposal.</para>

        want burritos” or “How about Chinese instead?” are not problems we can
        solve, so they are not productive. They will distract the group and
        need to be gently steered back to the question on the table (= “Is

        who is “the group,” so all of that still needs to be defined. So, for
        now, try to stay on the topic of the decision-making process only. The
        question is only: how do we as a group approve a proposal? To consent

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#46818D" fontsize="90%" -->I’d
              like to make sure we know how we make decisions. I propose
              consent as a decision-making method. What I mean by that is that
              if we have a proposal, we would ask each person in the group if
              they are ok with the proposal. It just needs to be good enough
              for each member of the group. That way, we can make decisions
              more easily without arguing. If something isn’t good enough, we
              will improve it together.<!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->

              person by person, whether they are willing to commit to consent

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->The
        practice of rounds is simple. By default, we speak one by one until

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Rounds
        are a manifestation of the principle that everyone’s voice matters.
        Rounds focus us because every round will have a prompt. That way, at
        any given point in time, we know what we are talking about. In that
        way, even though they seem lengthy at times, they save time
        overall.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->By
        the way, doing rounds is different from speaking at will and then
        saying, “let’s hear from the people who haven’t spoken.” While rounds
        presuppose that everyone’s voice counts equally, the missing voices
        are an afterthought in the second scenario.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Not
        everyone has to speak in every round. Some people might pass and not
        speak when it is their turn; they still have had the same chance to

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->What
        if someone objects? The most typical reason is that people find rounds
        “rigid.” Try your best to listen to what the basis of their objection
        is. Reflect it back to make sure they have been understood.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Most
        likely, it will be hard to predict whether the concern is connected to
        harm. It is probably true that the group may fulfill its aim both with
        or without rounds. What you can do is to offer a trial period, for
        example of three months. At the end of this trial period, people might
        have gotten used to rounds, or you might qualify when to do rounds and
        when not to do rounds.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->(In
        case you’re wondering why I am suggesting trial periods for rounds but
        not for consent, here is why. Let’s go back to the comparison with
        speaking in a language: consent is a decision on what language we even
        speak. Rounds are an add-on, like speaking in rhymes (more
        wholesome!). Yet, we can break rhymes from time to time without
        failure of communication. It’s good to do as much as possible but not
        a dealbreaker per se.)</para>

        is perfectly possible not to move forward. Maybe the needs and
        interests in the room are too diverse to fit into the same
        conversation. Going back to the aim as the song, you would not consent
        to singing three different songs at the same time, would you? Then
        don’t cluster too many things into the same project, only those that
        mutually enhance each other.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->What
        might be a sub-group of the same project and what makes the project
        too spread out to remain coherent is only for you to know. Take your
        own right to object or consent very seriously. If you compromise at
        this moment, you might regret it for years to come. It’s like a
        relationship that you are entering into. Are you where you want to
        be?</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->The
        same, of course, is true for everyone else. And I know that this is
        hard. It might mean that someone you like and respect – and maybe
        worked hard to get into this room – is not on board on the same aim
        and will leave the project. Remember that someone who doesn’t consent
        to the same aim might still remain connected, just not as a
        (decision-making) member of this group. They might cheer for your
        project from the sidelines, but they will not participate. That’s
        ok.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Again,
        be present with every fiber of your body. Take every red flag and
        belly ache seriously. Only move forward if you feel that clean, “Yes,
        I consent!” inside of you. For your project’s and your own sake, gift
        the group with the same honesty and integrity.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->It
        might be a good idea to hold off questions of membership, i.e., who
        will join and who won’t. For now, try to focus on what aim gives the
        project the best chances to be successful.</para>

        <para>In this agenda item, no decision is needed. All we need is
        sharing and listening. Most likely, everyone in the room has something
        they have to offer. Like in a gifting session, figuratively gather it

        shares, one by one, what they have to bring.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Frame
        the question well. Restate the aim. Ask, “when you think about this
        project with the aim (…), what can you think of that you bring as a
        resource, like previous experiences, connections, contacts, and
        resources? Let’s gather them all and make sure to write them
        down!”</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Writing
        them down will be useful for the future. You might go back to that
        list later as new people have joined, or the project focus has shifted
        or broadened. This list is your treasure box!</para>

        <title>What if…?</title>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->In
        my experience, some people tend to sell themselves a bit over or a lot
        under value, especially along gender lines. If you sense that is
        happening, you might raise that issue. If there are cross-connections
        between the group members, but not everyone knows each other, it might
        be a good idea to have another add to others’ list of resources. For
        example, let’s say it is Michelle’s turn and she understates that she
        has written two books on the topic. Wait until Michelle is complete
        and then ask others what they know about Michelle that might be of
        use.</para>

      A nice prompt that I use a lot is, “What are you passionate about?”, or
      “What was your path to get here?”. It’s a sure win because it gives
      everyone a chance to shine.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->If

        the context by explaining the situation. In an existing group,
        membership is approved by consent because a group needs to be able to
        decide who is a member. So if I want to join an existing group, the
        existing members of the group will need to consent to me
        joining.</para>

        possible objection might be that the group lacks experience in a

        might be relevant to your group.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->If
        there are objections, remember that this is the beginning and not cast
        in stone. For example, if someone objects based on gender balance,
        there could be a term date by which you re-evaluate the gender
        balance, and you put a plan in place on how to add people to your
        group to create a better mix. Note that in this case, with the term
        end and evaluation date, we are still striving for consent for now (as
        in “good enough”) and not putting off the decision. In that scenario,
        we would make ourselves members today but would commit to addressing
        the issue.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->If
        in any way possible, <emphasis role="bold">hold off on inviting others
        and just focus on group cohesion right now</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
        until the second meeting. I am guessing this will be hard. Maybe there
        is that person that was planning to come and couldn’t make it. But
        remember that this phase is critical for a good and robust launch. If
        new people join right now, I’d be worried that the commitments we made
        today get watered down.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->(If
        it’s one person or two, I’d personally be willing to compromise and –
        with everyone’s consent – invite them to the next meeting. For
        example, if someone in the group commits to sitting down with the
        incoming member to explain what was decided, I’d be comfortable to
        consent.)</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Can
        new members join the circle later? Yes, they can! However, I suggest
        that you wait until the second meeting to decide that. Don’t rush it –
        the principle of “the more, the merrier” can easily turn into “the
        more people, the less forward motion” if you don’t have an agreement
        on how to go about it.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->What
        if, for example, you love the aim of the group, but you don’t think
        that guy across from you has enough experience to join? Or if you’re
        worried that this person’s hardcode cynicism will make it harder to
        create a healthy group culture?</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->I
        know I am asking something almost impossible. After 2 hours with this
        new group, it’s a tall order to tell someone that you don’t consent to
        them being a part of the group. How could you?</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Yet,
        I don’t know what else to tell you. Only join the group if you are in
        integrity with yourself. If there is someone you are not willing to
        work with, find a place inside yourself that might give you the
        courage to address your concern. Maybe it is something that could be
        changed? For example, maybe that guy who talked so much could be told
        to hold his horses and listen more? I know it’s hard, and I can’t even
        promise that I would do it every time myself. Just consider the
        alternative of having to work with someone whose performance
        chronically undermines the group’s success. It’s a non-starter. Do
        yourself a favor and speak up.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Before
        you object, ask yourself whether your bad feeling is “just” based on a
        preference or whether it will harm the project. You don’t have to love
        everyone, and you’re not getting married to the project – but you have
        to be comfortable enough to operate well. Only you can decide.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->From
        the project’s perspective, it doesn’t matter how many people are in
        and how many are out. Once there is a group of at least two people,
        the project has officially launched with its first members.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->The
        worst outcome, however, is if people stay vague about their
        membership. Any project can only take a small number of people “riding
        along” before the group gets drained. Ask everyone to make up their
        minds – maybe offering one-on-one conversations outside of the
        meeting. Or invite them to come back and join later.</para>

      explicitly express interest, for example, by saying, <emphasis

        facilitator makes sure that a candidate is being proposed for each
        role. The easiest way to ensure that is to make a proposal.
        Alternatively, the facilitator can ask someone else to make a proposal
        and ask for consent. For example, this could sound like this: “I
        propose that Michelle be the leader of this group for six months, I be
        facilitator also for six months, and Marco be the secretary for six
        months. Are there any objections? Remember that you object if you have
        reasons to assume that we can’t fulfill our aim with that person in
        that role.” (Find more details and examples in <emphasis

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->If
        there are objections, try to integrate. For example, if an objection
        is that someone might not have enough time, propose a different
        candidate, shorten the original candidate’s term, or see if you can
        free that person up to serve this role. If the objection is that
        someone does not have enough experience, see if you can give them
        extra training, or shorten the term.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Some
        groups try to rotate or split roles. Both of those strategies reduce
        the clarity of who does what. As an alternative, we recommend having
        short terms (like three months) so that more people can hold roles
        over time but the first ‘officers’ can grow into their role.</para>

        do so, ask the group whether they see topics that might be put into a

        heard everyone, you harvest the ideas that emerged. The facilitator
        might make a proposal (or asks someone to make a proposal), for
        example, “I propose that we form a sub-circle on the topic XY.” You
        can then put that circle in place right away by defining aim, domain,
        leader, and a plan on how to populate the circle, or you put “forming

        and then ask the sub-circle to add people of their own choosing. That
        way, we give them a solid start but also a lot of choice. That
        sub-circle can add people outside the circle in the same way again as

        complete one and start the others. It’s your choice – together. For
        time and topic management, the facilitator can make a proposal, for
        example: “I propose we work on this topic for another 10 minutes and
        then we start the process for the other two items. Is there anyone who
        can’t work with that?” That way, you can get several things underway
        at the same time.</para>

      cells. Similarly, as cells in an organism are formed by another cell for

      certain purpose: the aim. As stated above, sub-circles receive the aim
      as well as their domain from their sub-circle. The parent circle also

        proposal to form a sub-circle</title>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Let’s
        look at what a proposal to form a sub-circle could look like to give
        you a good start. For our scenario, let’s imagine this is a group of 6
        that is meeting for the 5th time following this process. They know
        their aim, and they have all the roles clear, consent as
        decision-making, rounds for talking, they defined their circle
        membership by consent, and they know each other. As an example, let’s
        say this group has as its aim to run an organic and fair-trade tea
        store in Cambridge. While the original circle is talking about all
        aspects of this new enterprise (defining their audience, choice, and
        testing of products, researching suppliers, etc.), they also want to
        start looking for a physical location of their store. Early on, they
        had identified <emphasis role="from-text">physical
        location?</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
        as an open topic and put it on their backlog. In the prioritization,
        this topic ended up pretty high, so now it’s on the agenda.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->In
        talking about the topic, they notice that only some of the 6 have
        strong opinions and interests in this topic while others have more
        energy around other topics. The opinion forms that this topic best be
        held by a sub-set of the group because discussing it could easily take
        up all the available time, and they want the process to start in
        parallel to planning all the other aspects of the store. So they
        decide to form a sub-circle.</para>

        who is already a member of the parent circle for now – in several
        linking roles of different circles while the group is still small. As
        the organization and the sub-circles mature, non-founders will be in
        new positions more and more. If we spread too fast, our organization
        might become incoherent and disconnected – grow at a pace that feels
        refreshing but safe.</para>

        the store location. If this is not what the parent circle wants, it
        would need to be changed accordingly, for example, to “making a
        recommendation for a store location (to be approved by the parent
        circle)”. Ideally, sub-circles are empowered to make decisions –
        that’s what decentralized decision making is all about. It is a very

        the example of the tea store, the focus was on the mechanics of
        proposing and populating a sub-circle. In addition to the pure
        mechanics, we need to talk about culture. You want your organism to
        grow without turning into a hierarchical, centralized system. To
        achieve that, each of the parts needs to carry the same DNA as the

        for the sub-circle. (If the leader is not willing and able, make an
        alternative plan. For example, you could have a second person in the

              This agenda item applies in the same way as in a founding
              circle. You have a leader (selected by the parent circle), but
              you need to confirm that leader by consent. Sometimes the person
              convening the sub-circle doesn’t want to be leader beyond
              forming the circle. In that case, you simply add the leader role
              to the roles you need to select in a selection process.</para>

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->What’s
              different this time is that you also need to select a delegate.
              (Unlike the founding circle, you have a parent circle to link
              to!) That means you are selecting a facilitator, secretary,
              delegate, and maybe a (new) leader.</para>

              make sure that the person who is selected facilitator either is
              the most sociocratically-experienced person in the room or ask
              them to follow the processes laid out here. I can only offer
              this template – but I also know it only becomes lived experience
              if you choose to <emphasis role="from-text">use</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
              it.</para>

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Here’s
              another comment from having seen many of these processes. To
              become operational as fast as possible, it might seem to take a
              long time to select roles for the sub-circle. If you are itching
              to get going, just have the leader make a proposal who could
              fill which role, put a short term on it (!), and then approve by
              consent. In doing so, you are missing out on being more
              intentional and getting to know each other better, and I
              <emphasis role="from-text">definitely don’t</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
              recommend skipping full selection processes forever. But there’s
              a lot to say for starting lean, and it might make sense to jump
              into action fast while committing to do the full process once
              the first term is up. Setting terms on quick-and-dirty decisions
              is a great strategy of being fast but intentional. We don’t need
              to figure everything out right away before we can even do a
              first step. Instead, we experiment and commit to a timeline of
              when we will add more groundwork and reflection.</para>

              This agenda item from meeting #2 may or may not apply. You might
              simply decide to use the same communication system that the
              parent circle is using. Or maybe you want your own. If things
              are obvious, make a proposal, consent, and move on. If they are
              not obvious, take some time to talk.</para>

              This is an excellent practice for any new circle. Gathering
              topics for later discussion or decision will help the circle get
              to know each other’s priorities and understand what the circle’s
              scope (domain) is in each other’s perception. Compiling the list
              of future agenda items, therefore, is a good tool for alignment,
              hearing everyone, and making sure we can operate soon and with
              alignment to the whole.</para>

        <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->In
        my experience, a sub-circle can be kick-started within one meeting if
        things are easy and people are experienced. Instead of looking at the
        templates for the meetings one by one, look at the order of topics.
        They all build on each other. Go through them step by step while
        holding a good balance of diligence, pace, and pragmatism. Monitoring
        your own pace is a skill not unique to starting a self-governed
        organization, but it’s a skillset needed in all phases of your
        evolution as an organization. Here’s what I do: I follow common sense
        and go as fast as I think we <emphasis
        role="from-text">can</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->
        go. Then I slow it down just 10%. Why? Because it’s easy to be
        oblivious and miss pieces or concerns if you go too fast. Having to
        backtrack when we made a mess costs time. Also, I never compromise on
        consent – it’s our safety net to make sure all voices are ultimately
        heard.</para>

        reference, see the below list of items to form a sub-circle in the

            Feedback is something very different from making decisions. The
            feedback becomes input for the circle’s decision, allowing the

      time, you will most likely notice that your organization is great at
      doing things in many different places, but it lacks vision and long-term
      planning. That’s when you add a Mission Circle.</para>

      <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->The
      Mission Circle consists of some internal members and some external
      members – those are the people bringing fresh ideas into the
      organization and serving as a connection to the outside world. You form
      a Mission Circle in the same way you would form a sub-circle from the
      General Circle. You decide to form the sub-circle, define what you want
      it to do, select people from the inside and outside. (We wrote more

      would add a second, “bottom-up” link from the General Circle to the
      Mission Circle. No matter how you think about the directions, the leader
      of the GC and one additional person will make sure the Mission Circle
      and General Circle are well-connected by having two people who are
      members of both circles.</para>

      Sometimes, we might not pay attention, or there’s a current, then we
      bump into the banks. It’s not a big deal – we simply find our way out

              group identity and purpose is what I understand as the mission
              and aim. As you have seen in this booklet, the aim is the
              ‘initial spark’ that makes a group. It’s the invitation and the
              shared, explicitly agreed-upon aim of the group.</para>

              it’s the purpose that centers all the activity and the choices

              of the aims of the organization and the circle they are joining.

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->From
              a sociocratic perspective, these are conversations and decisions
              that need to be made on a policy level. For example, in a fully
              formed organization, a membership circle may host the
              conversation of “what are our expectations of volunteers?”
              Similarly, in a paid organization, compensation policies have to
              be worked out with a lot of feedback from all affected people.
              Be sure to talk about which domains those topics are held in to
              create clarity and a place where exploration can happen and
              people can give feedback if they are unhappy with the current
              status.</para>

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->If
              you are forming a volunteer group, creating the domains for

              on.</para>

              information flows well. The circles and consent only affect
              circle members, but you might have supporting members or simply
              members of other circles that need to be heard on matters that
              affect them. The responsibility of every circle includes getting

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Note
              that I am bundling two different principles here because they go
              hand in hand quite often. The question here is, how do we share
              information if something isn’t working, and how do we hold
              people accountable?</para>

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Both
              of these principles are woven into the practice, governance, and
              culture of our organizations. Sociocratic formats like reviews,
              selections, and meeting evaluations are wonderful, intentional
              feedback moments. Yet, it’s still people who need to make sure
              they get scheduled and taken seriously. I always say, meeting
              evaluations are good moments like sociocracy gives you the stage
              – but you have to decide to get up there!</para>

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->In
              my experience, a commitment to feedback is the hardest principle
              for people to stick to – they’d rather avoid it. That’s why it’s
              good to not only stick to the processes but also, from time to
              time, renew our commitment to taking in feedback. Feedback is a
              way to smoothen our collaboration and to re-align ourselves with
              each other and our new members.</para>

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->A
              sociocratic organization needs to be willing to defend its own
              functioning against inhibiting factors. For example, each circle
              has to be able to say no to people or even exclude them from a
              circle. (More about that in the sociocracy manual <emphasis
              role="from-text">Many Voices One Song.</emphasis><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->)
              We need to work into our policies how we hold people accountable
              if that becomes necessary.</para>

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->There
              are small things that make things easier. For example, the
              backlog is a great way to improve a circle’s own accountability,
              as well as tiny practices like checking who is present and who
              is filling what role in the ADMIN phase. It’s often the small
              stuff that starts to add up and lets people disengage from the
              work. Catch it, and improve it.</para>

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Every
              organization needs its own institutional support of conflict
              resolution. This is not only practical but also, in my view, a
              logical consequence of decentralized governance. You have to be
              able to address conflict in a decentralized way, wherever it
              might occur. In self-governance, there is no outside source of
              truth so working things out with each other is key to being and
              remaining a self-healing organization.</para>

              sociocratic organizations I know hold the values of restorative

              listening and 100% co-responsibility and shared power. There are
              great tools out there – use them wisely, use them often! The two

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->In
              my experience, an organization needs more than one avenue to
              address this conflict resolution well – but what it might look
              like highly depends on the context and culture. For example, an
              organization may make NVC training a requirement before joining
              or provide ongoing training for members. There might be a role
              of internal mediators or internal coaching to clarify
              disagreements before they grow into conflicts. There might be
              worksheets for internal work, buddy systems, online resources –
              start with a reasonable and doable solution, implement it,
              evaluate their effectiveness, and improve from there!</para>

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->This
              is an interesting one – and it may not be immediately obvious to
              you. This core design principle points to the fact that a
              self-governed organization will struggle if there is too much
              interference from the outside that the organization itself does
              not have control over. A good example is legal incorporation and
              models of ownership. You might never need this with your
              project, but sometimes it is hard for fully formed organizations
              to incorporate in a sociocratic way that matches their values.
              So in a way, it is the legal system that negatively impacts the
              freedom of a self-governing organization to determine how they
              want to do things.</para>

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->For
              example, what if the law says there has to be a board, and they
              have to make decisions by majority vote – but the organization
              wants to make decisions by consent and hold the power in the
              General Circle and its sub-circles? There are no dealbreakers
              here, but sometimes a little bit of a workaround is necessary.
              The same can be said for grant-givers or donors that want to
              determine how you run things – always make sure to create a
              context for your organization that gives you as much freedom and
              flexibility as possible and only adds limitations that you can
              integrate.</para>

              <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->This
              is more fun! As an organization, not only keep your context-free
              from negative interferences but also enhance your system with
              positive influence. For example, form partnerships, coalitions
              and invite others to be members of your Mission Circle. Meet
              other groups and keep things open and inviting.</para>

            is a governance system, not a magic fix for everyone. There are
            tons of processes out there that can enhance your practice and
            complement your governance processes.</para>

            <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->There
            are many good social technologies like Art of Hosting (incl. Open
            Space), Agile, Lean, Theory U, Permaculture, design thinking,
            Dragon Dreaming, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), The
            Work, The Work That Reconnects, and the psychological flexibility
            it brings…the list is long and full of wonderful, holistic
            practices.</para>

            <para><!--Warning: text element with unused attributes: color="#000000" fontsize="90%" -->Most
            of them work best in the realm of surfacing deeper information and
            more ideas. They can best be used in explorations, for example, to
            surface possible project ideas or to analyze issues more deeply.
            In a way, your circle might make a wonderful “excursion” to take a
            deep dive into a topic using some social technology, and then you
            turn your output into backlog items (for new ideas to tackle) or
            proposals (for potential solutions). That’s when sociocracy kicks
            in again to bring the decision over the finish line!</para>
