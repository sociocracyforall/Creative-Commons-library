    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>We all know what deep connection<indexterm>
        <primary>connection (need)</primary>
      </indexterm> feels like. We know it when we talk to a good friend who
    truly sees us. We all know what deep belonging<indexterm>
        <primary>belonging (need)</primary>
      </indexterm> feels like -- when we enter a group and we tap into knowing
    deep inside that these are our people. We all know what it feels like to
    be known<indexterm>
        <primary>to be known (need)</primary>
      </indexterm> and trusted, and to matter<indexterm>
        <primary>to matter (need)</primary>
      </indexterm> to the people around us and they to us.</para>

    <para>In every community of people, may it be at work, with friends,
    neighbors or family, it is connection that nurtures people. When we work
    alongside each other, care for each other and make decisions
    together.</para>

    <para>How can we have more of that? How can we be aligned with our need
    for connection<indexterm>
        <primary>connection (need)</primary>
      </indexterm> wherever we go, in our workplaces, neighborhoods, towns,
    clubs, faith groups, associations and in our families? We think that
    sociocracy can contribute to a more connected, integrated life. The
    principles behind sociocracy are not new. They are common sense. People
    have cooperated for as long as humanity exists. And still, we see a need
    to collect and describe tools and good practices so we can get more
    skilled with our interactions in organizations.</para>

    <para>Human interactions are complex and have simultaneous layers that we
    need to tend to as we cooperate. What are we doing and how are we doing
    it? Who and what do we depend on? How do we divide our labor in the best
    way? Who decides, how do we decide, and how do we talk about these
    decisions? It all boils down to how we relate to our work and how we
    relate to each other.</para>

    <para>Sociocracy is one of many systems that provide guidance in the
    process of relating to each other, in the context of organizations. Other
    systems focus on how we relate to each other in interpersonal
    relationships or in our relationship to our environment. Each of them
    attempting to integrate where we are separated, to aid where we struggle,
    and to broaden our minds where we are stuck.</para>

    <para>What does it take to lead a more integrated life, to form a more
    connected society, to create communities with more sense of
    belonging<indexterm>

      </indexterm><indexterm>
        <primary>needs; examples</primary>

    ingredients.<itemizedlist>

          <para>We need tools and systems that support listening,
          participation, agency and a way to link our minds and hearts to work

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>We need practice. We need to unlearn the messages that have
          harmed us, and to re-tell each other the stories that reunite us.
          Regular practice changes the fabric between us. It strengthens our
          skills and carries real change into the world.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>We need hope. Hope comes with the confidence that we are
          agents that can change the world. Hope that together, we can create
          systems that serve people close to us and in the larger community,
          without doing harm somewhere else.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>In organizations, we come together to achieve a shared
    aim. In singing together, every voice contributes, even though they might
    not be singing the same tune. We each sing our part and together, it
    sounds more beautiful than what any individual can accomplish alone. Hence
    the book title “<citetitle>Many voices one song</citetitle>”!</para>

    <title>Acknowledgements</title>

    <para>We are deeply grateful to the legacy of everyone contributing to the
    wonderful set of tools that we know as sociocracy. Above all, this is
    Gerard Endenburg<indexterm>
        <primary>Endenburg, Gerard</primary>
      </indexterm> who developed the sociocratic circle method<indexterm>
        <primary>Sociocratic Circle Method (SCM)</primary>
      </indexterm> and the many people in The Sociocracy Group, like Annewiek
    Reijmer, who advanced and spread sociocracy for decades. Marshall
    Rosenberg, who developed the theory and practice of Non-Violent
    Communication<indexterm>
        <primary>NVC (Non-Violent Communication)</primary>
      </indexterm>, and Gerard Endenburg are like hidden co-authors of this
    book. We are also grateful for John Buck and Sharon Villines who brought
    sociocracy to the English-speaking world and who supported us in
    publishing this book.</para>

    <para>Many people in different places are now working on sociocracy. We
    enjoy our heartfelt connections with quite a few of them. They have each
    shaped our thinking with their unique perspective. Among them are John
    Schinnerer, Francine Proux-Kenzle, Sheella Mierson, Linda Cote-Small, Gina
    Price, Diana Leafe-Christian. We are grateful for our connection with
    James Priest and Lili David, with Barbara Strauch, with Rakesh RootsMan,
    Pierre Houben, John MacNamara, Marcia Carlson, Kent Smith, Ruth Andrade,
    Tanya Stergiou, Peter Richtsteig. We have received support from Vincent
    Van Der Lubbe and Leif Hanack, Eric Tolson, Laureen Golden, Daniel King,
    Martyn Griffin and many members of Sociocracy For All. A special thank you
    goes to the book circle that supported the editing process for this book:
    Elle Vallance, Stephanie Nestlerode, John Root. Gloria Zmolek, Allyn
    Steffen, Jesse Marshall, Mukunda Das, Randall Johnson, Simon Copsey,
    Harris Kaloudis, Parveen Sherif, Julya Rose, Ben Roberts, John Buck,
    Frederic Laloux, Richard Longman, Georges Romme, Jan Höglund, Jutta
    Eckstein and Stephane Brodu helped us improve this book. Julian Howell,
    with his knowledge of design and sociocracy made the design clear and
    simple – he came up with the way this book represents double-linking.
    Edwin M John’s vision and the neighborhood parliaments have a place in our
    hearts.</para>

    <para>We are grateful for the many organizations, communities and the
    individuals we have worked with. The biggest inspiration in our lives are
    the people we train all over the world, as we spend hour after hour in
    video calls exploring details of human organizations and interactions
    together. Many of our training participants are now peers in our
    membership organization, Sociocracy For All, and they continue to be a
    source of companionship<indexterm>

    <para>Thanks also to our personal network: Gina Simm, Jennifer Ladd, Darla
    Stabler, Nancy Bair, Greg Bates, Sophia Rau, Helena Rau, Jochen Rau. The
    place we call home, Pioneer Valley Cohousing community, provided not only
    practice ground for sociocracy but was also where we met.</para>

    <para>This book is just the beginning, and just a small piece of a
    collective journey into a collaborative future. May it do good in the
    world!</para>

    does not appear or disappear – someone will be holding it. We have to be
    <emphasis>intentional</emphasis> about how we want to distribute it. Power
    is like water: it will go <emphasis>somewhere</emphasis> and it tends to
    accumulate in clusters: the more power a group has, the more resources
    they will have to aggregate more power. The only way to counterbalance the
    concentration of power is intentionality and thoughtful
    implementation<indexterm>
        <primary>implementation</primary>
      </indexterm>.</para>

    <para>Power, like water, is neither good nor bad. In huge clusters and
    used against the people, power will be highly destructive. Used to serve
    the people and the earth, distributed to places where it can work toward
    meeting the needs<indexterm>
        <primary>needs</primary>
      </indexterm> of the people and the earth, power is constructive,
    creative, and nourishing like an irrigation system.</para>

    <para>One can think of a sociocratic organization<indexterm>
        <primary>organization</primary>

        <secondary>sociocratic organization</secondary>
      </indexterm> as a complicated irrigation system, empowering each team to
    have the agency and resources they need to flourish and contribute toward
    the organization’s mission. We avoid large clusters of power, and we make
    sure there is flow. Water that is allowed to flow will stay fresh and will
    reach all the places in the garden, nourishing each plant to flourish.
    Sociocratic organizations nourish and empower each team to have the agency
    to flourish and contribute toward the organization’s mission.</para>

    <para>Power does not have only one source. In that respect, power is
    different from an irrigation system. <emphasis>All</emphasis> members of
    the organization feed their own agency and resources into the
    organization, in each team. <emphasis>Everyone contributes their power and
    relies on each other’s power.</emphasis> From there, power, and with it,
    resources, gets distributed into the whole and gets channeled to where the
    group wants to put their energy. Sociocratic organizations keep everyone’s
    own agency and power intact and support people to make changes bigger than
    they could have made alone.</para>

    <para>In order to achieve this, our sociocratic organizations differ from
    organizations with aggregated, centralized hierarchical power in two
    ways:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>We distribute power more evenly. Those who come with less
          agency get support to step into more agency. Those who come with
          more sense of agency contribute toward the whole without diminishing
          anyone else’s power. Teams doing work together are empowered to
          contribute.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>We let power flow. Flow means the distribution of power needs
          to be adjusted and potentially changed over time. The sociocratic
          organization is adaptable and resilient.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>Building a system that distributes power by empowering
    everyone requires thought and intentionality. That is what sociocracy is:
    the design principles for distributing power in a way that flows with
    life.</para>

        <para>Organizations are designed in a way that fosters our connection
        with each other and with ourselves, both within and outside of the
        organization. To effectively create connections, organizations need to
        be life-serving and all-embracing. <emphasis>Life-serving</emphasis>
        means that we want to foster organizations that work for everyone in
        the organization and hold care for everyone affected by the
        organization. No one and nothing can be ignored if we want to honor
        connection.</para>

        <para>We want to support living organizations. Living systems can be
        on any kind of scale: a cell is a living system as it creates a
        membrane, forms an identity and interacts as a whole with its outside.
        Organizations are living systems: they interact with their outside
        (clients, students, consumers, investors), and their members on the
        inside interact as and information, goods, and energy are being
        exchanged. A system that does not let the organization breathe like a
        living system will constrain and muffle its unique expression of life.

        <para>In Sociocracy For All, we get requests<indexterm>

        meetings to see what they feel like. As we welcome visitors whenever
        possible, we have a standard response to their request: Be aware that
        in a sociocratic meeting one might not see anything amazing. Good
        governance is invisible. Good governance means getting everything out
        of the way that distracts us. Distracting feelings can be generated
        when our needs for connection<indexterm>

        want to create a context of clarity for our work, for emotional safety
        amongst all team members and for process. What exists then is flow.
        Flow happens when a group is fully and creatively immersed in their
        process. Governance as a tool blends into the background and in the
        foreground is content. Good governance is therefore invisible. It only
        serves to create the conditions where we can be productive

      <para>In self-governance, we want groups to decide for themselves how to

        <para>To us, running organizations in alignment with principles is

          </indexterm> where all needs are considered is more important than

        effectiveness), do it. In that case, please share so others can
        benefit as well! To us, sociocracy is a mindset: the mindset that all
        needs matter, always. The needs of those who we serve, the needs of
        those who work together, the needs of all interdependent life on the
        planet, and the needs of the generations to come.</para>

        <para>Sociocracy is <emphasis>not</emphasis> an all-or-nothing
        approach. Readers can use as few or many features and tools as they
        want and they can change their minds over time. No one owns the
        individual tools. People do what they do. There is no right and wrong.
        There are only more and less effective tools for managing and

        equivalence<indexterm>
            <primary>equivalence</primary>
          </indexterm>. We recommend taking all that seems useful, and to keep

        have areas that need improvement.</para>

        <indexterm>
          <primary>consent</primary>

          <secondary>consent to governance changes</secondary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>We have devoted this time in our lives to spreading sociocracy
        because we are convinced that it is an excellent set of principles and
        tools, and we have picked the tools that we are describing in this
        book based on years of experience, observing different tools and
        techniques and their impact. Governance is a highly complex construct.
        If one makes a change in one spot, one might shift the balance in a
        different place. For that reason, we recommend to stay as close as
        possible to the basic tools and to use as many of them as possible.
        The tools one uses can easily be adapted – as long as one measures the
        success of your adaptation. As practitioners gain experience, they can
        be more flexible with the tools.</para>

        <para>Consent is the default decision-making method in sociocracy.
        Consent means that if I make a proposal<indexterm>
            <primary>proposal</primary>
          </indexterm> to the group, my proposal will be approved if no one in
        the group has an objection<indexterm>
            <primary>objection</primary>
          </indexterm> to it. Consent will be addressed deeply in this manual
        but this description might suffice for now.</para>

        <para>By consent, a group can decide to do anything. We often jokingly
        say, you want a dictator for your organization? We can decide that by
        consent. (We recommend that the dictator role have a term end,
        however!) Groups can decide by consent to vote. Groups decide what
        their governance system looks like at all times.<indexterm>
            <primary>decision-making</primary>

            <secondary>method</secondary>
          </indexterm> The only thing one cannot do is ignore reasoned
        objections.</para>

        <para>So let’s say a group decides to use only the organizational
        structure from sociocracy and to combine it with majority rule as your
        decision-method. That is allowed -- because it is your decision. Here
        is the catch: We have talked to countless organizations. When they
        struggle around governance, it is always for either or both of these
        reasons: (1) They have gaps in their implementation<indexterm>
            <primary>implementation</primary>
          </indexterm>, or (2) They have not invested enough resources in
        education.<indexterm>
            <primary>education around governance</primary>
          </indexterm></para>

        <para>So we hereby say it: we want groups to take full ownership of
        your own governance system. <emphasis>And</emphasis> we want to give
        them the most exhaustive and accurate and experience-based information
        we can possibly give because we think this is an excellent set of
        principles and most tweaks we have seen were detrimental.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Beginnings</title>

          <para>The term ‘‘sociocracy’’ was brought into common use by the
          French philosopher Auguste Comte in the 1850’s. The word began to
          take its current meaning in the 1940’s in a Quaker<indexterm>
              <primary>Quaker</primary>
            </indexterm> school in the Netherlands.</para>

          <para>The founders of that school, Kees Boeke<indexterm>
              <primary>Boeke, Kees</primary>
            </indexterm> and Betty Cadbury were Quakers, educators, and peace
          activists. Boeke saw sociocracy as a form of governance that
          presumes equality of individuals. This equality is not expressed
          with the ‘‘one man, one vote’’ law of democracy, but rather by a
          group of individuals (the circle) reasoning together until a
          decision is reached that is satisfactory to each one of them. To
          make sociocratic ideals operational, Boeke used a system of circles
          to organize decision making within a large organization. Members of
          each circle were responsible for decisions within their domain. Each
          circle elected representatives to a ‘‘higher’’ circle. Use of
          representatives maintained the efficiency of a hierarchy<indexterm>
              <primary>hierarchy</primary>
            </indexterm> while maintaining basic equivalence<indexterm>
              <primary>equivalence</primary>
            </indexterm> of the members of the organization. The school was
          unique in that the teachers and the students participated in
          decision making about the running of the school.</para>

          <para>One of the students in that school, Gerard Endenburg<indexterm>
              <primary>Endenburg, Gerard</primary>
            </indexterm>, went on to study engineering. He further developed
          and applied <indexterm>
              <primary>Boeke, Kees</primary>
            </indexterm>Boeke’s principles in the company he took over from
          his parents, the electrical engineering company Endenburg
          Elektrotechniek. He articulated the four basic principles as we now
          know them. This resulted in a formal organizational method, named
          the <citetitle>“Sociocratische Kringorganisatie Methode”</citetitle>
          (SCM: the Sociocratic Circle Method).<indexterm>
              <primary>Sociocratic Circle Method (SCM)</primary>
            </indexterm></para>

          <para>Gerard Endenburg intended sociocracy to be a method that
          includes and invites people to show up in their organizations as
          co-responsible whole human beings. Sociocracy was brought to the
          United States primarily by John Buck, co-author with Sharon Villines
          of the 2007 book on sociocracy, <citetitle>We The People: Consenting
          to a Deeper Democracy</citetitle>. Jerry Koch-Gonzalez studied and
          worked with John, and Ted J. Rau has done the same with
          Jerry.</para>

          <para>As time passes since the early days of sociocracy, variations
          in its application have emerged, most notably Holacracy<indexterm>
              <primary>Holacracy</primary>
            </indexterm> and Sociocracy 3.0.<indexterm>
              <primary>Sociocracy 3.0</primary>
            </indexterm> An exploration of the similarities and differences in
          the variations of sociocracy is beyond the scope of this book. The
          sociocratic lineage of Sociocracy For All is “classical” sociocracy
          - meaning directly from Gerard Endenburg<indexterm>
              <primary>Endenburg, Gerard</primary>
            </indexterm> and the Sociocratic Circle Method<indexterm>
              <primary>Sociocratic Circle Method (SCM)</primary>
            </indexterm> that he and others developed.</para>

          <para>In this book we have tried to only use and coin jargon where
          it supports clarity. How true ‘‘Many Voices One Song’’ is to
          classical sociocracy will be a matter of debate. We do not intend
          with this book to start another variation, and we view any
          fragmentation of the movement around circle-based power with some
          sadness and skepticism. Our intent is to be Sociocracy For All,
          which -- for us -- means that we support any effort to spread
          sociocracy and sociocracy-related education<indexterm>
              <primary>education around governance</primary>
            </indexterm> and application.</para>

          </indexterm>

          <para>In the USA, sociocracy is also known as Dynamic Governance or
          Dynamic Self-Governance. These names were chosen to emphasize the
          dynamic nature of sociocracy and because the word sociocracy
          generated negative reactions. To some people, the word sociocracy
          sounded like socialism, implying the loss of individual freedom. To
          others, the word sociocracy sounded like another oppressive
          power-over “-cracy”. And for even others, sociocracy was just a
          strange word that was hard to pronounce.</para>

          <para>In using the original term, Sociocracy For All acknowledges
          the international nature of the sociocratic movement.</para>

          <title>The spread of sociocracy</title>

          <para>Sociocracy originated in the Netherlands, which also explains
          a bigger density of sociocratic organizations there. It has since
          spread slowly in all sectors.</para>

          <para>Cohousing communities and ecovillages have been early adopters
          of sociocracy in Europe and in North and South America. The
          combination of sociocracy being grounded in community and equal
          voice had a special appeal in intentional communities. Different
          from consensus<indexterm>
              <primary>consensus</primary>

              <secondary>consent vs. consensus</secondary>
            </indexterm>, sociocracy balances the needs of a group with that
          of the individual which is essential to keep a community sane.
          Intentional communities were (and many still are) grappling with
          their own governance, but they are places where:<itemizedlist>

          individuals who were, and have been, promoting sociocracy and were
          themselves deeply rooted in intentional communities. Driving the
          spread of sociocracy was also the conviction that if they, living
          together with some sense of shared purpose, cannot work through
          miscommunications and struggles, then there is no hope for those who
          aren’t living together, do not have a shared purpose, and have enemy
          images of each other. Some wanted to prove that working toward a
          common <indexterm>
              <primary>aim</primary>
            </indexterm>aim in a community while maintaining harmony
          <emphasis>can</emphasis> be done. Others simply wanted to reduce the
          time spent in meetings. The authors of this book live in an
          intentional community.</para>

          <para>Up to this day, those are two possible entry-ways into
          sociocracy. Some people want a system that is more aligned with
          their values of an egalitarian, more just society. Others value and
          appreciate sociocracy for the clarity, effectiveness<indexterm>

            </indexterm> and transparency<indexterm>
              <primary>transparency</primary>

            </indexterm> and value-based organizations, people interested in
          non-violent communication (NVC).</para>

          <para>Because people have different priorities that they see in
          sociocracy, their responses will be very different. We would like to
          honor the variety of experiences by just making a list of original
          quotes of people stating what sociocracy means to them.</para>

        <para>Sociocracy is not the only movement that supports life-serving
        collaboration. There are other movements that we call the ally
        movements, in which, organically, sociocracy has been growing in the

        person has the key to everything, and no one movement will always be
        able to meet all our needs for new systems for all areas of our life.
        Together, however, these movements, systems and mindsets are potent
        game changers in how our societies operate.</para>

        <para>It is wonderful to see how people take what they know, combine
        it with sociocracy, and make it into something better. The individuals
        we have worked and been in contact with have typically been from one
        of the above movements. There are sociocratic elder care facilities,
        homeschooling groups, consulting companies, community organizations,
        restaurants, and summer camps for families. The most touching
        experience for us has been to hear how tens of thousands of children
        in India change their immediate situation through their
        neighborhood-based parliaments<indexterm>
            <primary>government</primary>

            <secondary>neighborhood parliaments</secondary>

        <para>We, the authors of this book, are in the lucky position of
        beneficiaries. We have learned an incredible amount about all those
        movements through our students who often pointed out to us how
        sociocratic values applied in their particular situation. There are
        people implementing sociocracy in families, relationships, dance
        associations, and faith-based groups. The mindset behind sociocracy
        dovetails with a vision so much bigger than governance: a world based
        on integration and cooperation.</para>

      <title>How to use this manual</title>

      <para>Governance is tricky to teach. The biggest challenge is that one
      has to know everything at the same time. Practitioners have to know the
      meeting format, all processes, understand consent, know what a helping
      circle is, how to do a round, be aware of feedback, have emotional
      literacy and needs consciousness<indexterm>
          <primary>needs</primary>

          <secondary>needs consciousness</secondary>
        </indexterm> and more at once – oh, and be aware of operational roles!
      Sociocratic governance works best if practitioners master it all. How
      can we achieve that? We tried to write this book so readers can browse
      through the book, reading sections at a time. That is the reason why
      there is some repetition in the book, as we strive to keep each section
      more or less comprehensive.</para>

      <para>We compare it to learning how to swim. We can talk a lot about how
      to shape your hand for the perfect breaststroke or the line your arms
      have to form when doing a crawl stroke. But if we are struggling to stay
      afloat, that is irrelevant information because it is too detailed. If we
      forget our feet while focusing on our breathing we might still go down.
      The first step is to stay above the water. Then make your strokes more
      efficient, work on breathing, better form and so on. If you ever learned
      to swim and you were taught explicitly, you might remember that moving
      through water seemed impossible at first. Then, after practice,
      practice, practice, something clicks. We get the hang of it.</para>

      <para>So, we are swimming teachers. We want readers to stay above the
      water without anxiety. If you are a beginner whose goal it is to stay
      above water, you are holding a book in your hands that gives you a level
      of detail that is probably too much for now. If we could wave a magic
      wand, we would want readers to read it twice and practice in between.
      Then read it again six months later. It will be an entirely different
      book by then because more experienced learners will take in the
      information very differently.</para>

      <para>When teaching our daughters to swim, I would often take them on my
      back to give them a sense of swimming, feeling the movements in their
      body. I was hoping that the different elements might make more sense to
      them after experiencing them together. That’s what <orgname>Sociocracy
      For All</orgname><indexterm>
          <primary>Sociocracy For All (SoFA)</primary>
        </indexterm> does in online training. We figuratively throw teams of
      people into a pool and safely carry them through initial meetings,
      letting go more and more as they are able to stay afloat by
      themselves.</para>

      <para>That is not the case for this book. Some people have an easy time
      applying what they read to real-life contexts. For many, it will be
      hard, and we encourage readers to get help. Much of this book makes
      sense once one has first-hand experience. If this does not correspond to
      how you prefer to learn, we can work with you in finding different ways
      to learn, or we can refer you to a coach. (See links to resources in

        collaborative translation projects.</para>

    full-fledged organizations, some start out as a group of friends working

        <secondary>sociocratic organization</secondary>
      </indexterm> can be as small as three people, or as large as

    <para>Since the organizational structure in sociocracy is decentralized,
    the system can grow and adapt on its own. New branches can be formed
    following the same mechanisms, like a tree that forms buds in the right
    place when the right time comes. Growth (and de-growth) is smooth and
    follows the demand and intention of the organization.</para>

      <title>The circle</title>

      <indexterm>
        <primary>circle</primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>We call work teams ‘‘circles’’. They are the heart of every
      organization. A circle is a group of people who work together and decide
      together how the work is being done. Circles are a way to ‘‘package’’
      related parcels of work and to focus attention easily and maximally,
      while still keeping the pieces of the whole connected. The difference
      between non-sociocratic committees and circles is that circles have more
      authority<indexterm>
          <primary>authority</primary>

          <secondary>in domain</secondary>
        </indexterm> and the requirement to be connected to the other circles.
      Circles are never floating around, they are always linked to another
      related circle. An ideal circle structure<indexterm>
          <primary>circle</primary>

          <secondary>circle structure</secondary>
        </indexterm> will represent the idea of ‘‘a place for everything, and
      everything in its place’’. Since the circle structure<indexterm>
          <primary>circle</primary>

          <secondary>circle structure</secondary>
        </indexterm> is also dynamic, we have order without having rigidity.
      We can grow, adapt, and be nimble.</para>

        </indexterm>. Sociocracy translates to “those who associate together
      govern together”. The circle members are the experts of the work they
      do, and they have the skills and knowledge to govern <emphasis

          <primary>policy</primary>

          <secondary>decision-making power</secondary>

      for that area. For example, the group of people that takes care of
      membership matters in an organization decides <emphasis

      <para>As clusters of tasks get more complex, we divide up the tasks and

          <primary>circle</primary>

          <secondary>sub-circle</secondary>
        </indexterm>. Like in a fractal structure, there can be <indexterm>

      the circle system. If one circle struggles, there will be a circle
      around it that can help the circle get back on track.</para>

      authority<indexterm>

        </indexterm> and power to act. No one has to wait for anyone’s
      approval.<informalexample>
          <para>Imagine a customer has a request for a change in a recipe for
          a Pastry Circle in a bakery restaurant. Let’s say, a loyal customer
          is allergic to hazelnut and is asking whether there could be
          chocolate croissants without hazelnut. The request is in the
          <indexterm>
              <primary>domain</primary>
            </indexterm>domain of Pastry Circle. Pastry circle will consider
          this request. Let’s assume they decide to change their recipe. They
          do not have to ask anyone for permission, they just change
          it.</para>
        </informalexample>In addition, workers will have a high level of
      buy-in and intrinsic motivation because they are taking full
      responsibility. No one will be forced to do anything they do not see the
      need to be doing because everyone in the circle<indexterm>
          <primary>circle</primary>
        </indexterm> decides together what and how it is being done. Again, in
      our example, if someone sees harm in making puff pastry for the Pastry
      Circle or the entire bakery, the group of workers in that area will be
      able to address this. No policy <emphasis role="from-text">in their own

      <para>We think of it as a living organism where each system (respiratory
      system, circulatory system, nervous system, etc.) is autonomous in that
      it responds to needs in its own system. The respiratory system does not
      have to ask permission from the circulatory system. Every system (every
      circle) takes care of their own needs. On the other hand, however, the
      systems are interdependent: if the muscular system requires more oxygen,
      this will affect the respiratory system. One system over-ruling the
      other systems does not sound healthy. Circles<indexterm>

          <para>How is the <indexterm>
              <primary>aim</primary>
            </indexterm>aim different from visions or missions? In an aim, we
          define what it is we are doing. Aims are what we need to do to get
          us closer to fulfilling our mission, and working toward our vision.
          Someone wants to end homelessness? If that is the mission, then the
          vision might be a world with adequate shelter for every human being.
          Visions and missions are helpful to create a set of shared values,
          but it is more important to define the aims of the organization. The
          mission informs the aims, but the aims will be the backdrop for
          every policy decision<indexterm>
              <primary>decision</primary>

              <secondary>policy decision</secondary>
            </indexterm> one makes in the organization (see <xref
          linkend="objections" xrefstyle="select: label"/>).</para>

          <para>It is not enough to only define the vision and mission.
          Organizations with the same mission and vision might have very
          different aims. The mission of “ending homelessness” can be
          accomplished by different aims which are the strategies we are
          using, as shown in <xref linkend="samemissiondifferentaimsJH"
          xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>.</para>

          <para>On the flipside, we might have very different visions and
          still be able to get behind the same aim. (To some extent, this is
          probably true more often than we realize!) For example, for
          volunteers at a vegetarian soup kitchen, the motivation might be
          health, or environmental or ethical concerns. The same strategy can
          be in support of very different needs.</para>

          get there. In SoFA’s case, it is about making knowledge accessible.
          We want to live in a world that works for everyone (no one is

          distributed outwards to the most specific circles -- the most
          localized level possible. Authority<indexterm>
              <primary>authority</primary>
            </indexterm> has to go along with that so those circles are free
          to act. Aims and domains always parallel each other indivisibly.
          Imagine a Website Circle that has to ask for the password for every
          change they make. That would slow this circle down. Instead, we want
          to hand over the authority to manage the password completely (if
          they are the only ones needing access). The idea is full
          empowerment: by default, a circle will have the <indexterm>
              <primary>power</primary>
            </indexterm>power to act in their <indexterm>
              <primary>domain</primary>
            </indexterm>domain. The only reason to restrict their authority is
          because a different group might need some authority as well; not out
          of a desire to maintain control. The same is true for labor and
          financial budget<indexterm>
              <primary>budget</primary>
            </indexterm>: a circle has a budget which is agreed upon by the
          next-higher circle. Within the limits of their own budget, the
          circle has full authority over how to spend the money and allocate
          labor hours. See table <xref linkend="aimsincoop"

                the domains which now include the stairs for Basement Circle.
                Or we might have reason to assume that First Floor Circle

                    shop floor stairs, but they wanted the community building
                    to have a ‘‘living room’’ look. Both circles assumed they

          be. A circle cannot change its aim unilaterally, but it can propose
          a revised aim to its parent circle for consent. When a circle’s aim

          foundational policy. They are not cast in stone; instead, they are
          in place to support your work.</para>

          <para>As we write down aims and domains, go by what makes sense to

          <title>On the question of nomenclature: hierarchy</title>

          <para>We have been talking about ‘‘sub’’-circles<indexterm>
              <primary>circle</primary>

              <secondary>sub-circle</secondary>

              <primary>aim</primary>

              <secondary>sub-aim</secondary>
            </indexterm>. Does that mean sociocracy is hierarchical? If so,
          how does that go together with the idea of governance as
          equals?</para>

          <para>The hierarchy in sociocracy is a hierarchy of specificity of
          aims and domains, not a hierarchy of oppressive power. A Dishwashing
          Circle makes very few policies and does a lot of specific,
          operational work (the dishes!). A Board of Directors does little
          operational work and spends most of its time on long-term planning
          and the abstract level of overarching organizational policies that
          are not made by individual circles. In the original development of
          sociocracy, the Board of Directors Circle was labeled ‘‘Top
          Circle’’. People are attracted to sociocracy because of how it
          embodies egalitarianism. Words like top circle, higher circles,
          lower circles and even the word leader can trigger discomfort and
          the assumption of the existence of an oppressive power
          structure<indexterm>
              <primary>power</primary>

              <secondary>perception of power</secondary>
            </indexterm>. So we look for different ways to describe the
          continuum of circles from specific to abstract. For example, instead
          of Top Circle or even Board of Directors, we use the term “Mission
          Circle”.</para>

          <para>Organizations can choose the wording they prefer. For sheer
          simplicity, we often talk of “high” vs. “low” among people who are
          aware of the lack of oppressive force in sociocracy. To create
          clarity for those new to sociocracy, we chose to use “sub” as a
          prefix – the way we also encounter it in power-neutral systems, for
          example in “submarine” and “subcontinent”. It would never occur to
          us to assume that people in submarines do less valuable work than
          people in a ship. In the same way, the requirements and the aspects
          to pay attention to are different for dishwashers than for kitchen
          planners, although their domains are related.</para>

          <para>We often use “broad” vs. “specific” (as in Figure <xref
          linkend="broadfocusspecificfocus" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>)
          in training contexts where we have more time to explain and can
          avoid confusion around the terminology. But those terms seem
          cumbersome and chances are, people might be driven away because it
          sounds complicated. Our overall <indexterm>
              <primary>aim</primary>
            </indexterm>aim is to make sociocracy accessible, not to make it

          <para>Whatever words an organization uses, here are three ideas to
          consider. Every organizational structure can be drawn in different

          xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> describe the exact same
          organizational design for an organization, some looking more
          hierarchical, some less so. We can avoid a perception of linear
          hierarchy<indexterm>
              <primary>hierarchy</primary>

              <secondary>linear hierarchy</secondary>
            </indexterm> by drawing a more circular structure – but even that
          comes with connotations (periphery vs. center, peripheral being
          interpreted as “marginal”).</para>

          fix bikes and, at the same time, be part of a circle that does
          long-term planning. The point is that the circle that oversees bike
          repairs has very tangible and specific work, while a board deals
          with abstract long-term planning. Any person might do either job,
          but the focus is different depending on what we are paying attention

          <para>There are cases where a member of an organization is not part
          of a work circle. For some types of organizations, this will be more
          common (like in platform cooperatives); for others, it will be ruled
          out (most for-profit businesses). It depends on the requirements for
          membership in the organization whether or in what way this is
          possible. Membership in the organization, with its privileges and
          responsibilities, may be separate from circle membership.</para>

          <para>For example, in an intentional community, an individual can be
          part of the community and do work (dishwash, code, mow the lawn)
          without being part of any of the corresponding policy-making
          circles. In a platform coop, not every contributing member will be
          part of a work circle that makes policy of how the platform is run.
          If we imagine a sociocratically run town<indexterm>
              <primary>government</primary>

              <secondary>town government</secondary>
            </indexterm>, we would not expect every resident to be part of the
          administration. (See more thoughts in section <xref
          linkend="few-and-many"
          xrefstyle="select: labelnumber page"/>.)</para>

          <para>The tricky point here is that we have to be aware that
          sociocracy was not designed for cases of many members that are not
          connected to the circle system. We have to make sure to hear their
          voice and consider their needs for all decisions – which is harder
          if someone is removed from policy making. To give a short answer to
          a complex topic: no, not every member of the organization has to be
          part of a circle, but it is easier to run an inclusive organization
          if as many organizational members are part of at least one circle as
          makes sense in their context.</para>

          </indexterm>

          <para>There is also the option of removing a member from a circle.
          It is crucial to have that option because working together only
          works if all the circle members are productive in the way that the
          circle requires. If a member is not able to work well with others
          (for whatever reason) then making decisions may be challenging for
          the circle. For example, a member’s sarcastic and blaming style of
          communication may interfere with the well-functioning of the group.
          If constructive circle members leave a circle because they dislike
          someone’s behavior, an open conversation is overdue. If a circle
          member’s behavior keeps a circle from being functional, that is a
          clear example of ‘‘we cannot work with this’’, hence an
          objection<indexterm>
              <primary>objection</primary>

              <secondary>objection to circle membership</secondary>
            </indexterm> to a circle member’s circle membership. Sociocracy,
          while strengthening individual power, also protects groups, and for
          <indexterm>
              <primary>consent</primary>
            </indexterm>consent decision making to be possible, groups have to
          be protected from dysfunction.</para>

          <para>Excluding someone from a circle, on the ‘‘process level’’, is
          easy. It is a proposal<indexterm>
              <primary>proposal</primary>

              <secondary>proposal to remove from a circle</secondary>
            </indexterm> <emphasis role="from-text">“I propose that XY be
          removed from the circle”</emphasis> (with a rationale and term). For
          example, a member may continually take action outside the aim/domain
          of the circle or continually push for favorite projects without
          consideration for the perspective of others.</para>

          <para>After presenting the proposal, we can invite clarifying
          questions and quick reactions. The circle member that is potentially
          removed from the circle can ask questions and give their quick
          reaction. In the consent round<indexterm>
              <primary>consent round</primary>
            </indexterm>, that person does not have consent rights. This last
          aspect makes it slightly more specific from a regular proposal where
          every circle member has consent rights<indexterm>

          <para>We are aware that removing someone from a circle will be near
          the end-point of a lot of emotional struggle. We all care about the
          people we work with and we strive for harmony. It is crucial to know
          of this option and how to perform it. We highly recommend <emphasis

          that respect is a basic requirement, but not everyone agrees on what
          respect looks like, and under what conditions it is appropriate to
          prioritize, for example, honesty over respect. Make an effort to
          understand what their self-conception looks like and find good
          balance on how much time your circle is willing to devote. (See some

          <primary>domain</primary>
        </indexterm> that define their work. In addition, circles need some
      internal structure to function well. Of course, we can define (by
      consent) what those features might be in a particular organization. What
      we describe here is what is considered good practice and has been used
      in many sociocratic organizations. We have not seen any need to deviate
      from this basic structure, but readers might find their own way.</para>

      <para>Why do we define roles? For the same reason that we make policy:
      for effectiveness<indexterm>
          <primary>effectiveness</primary>
        </indexterm>, and clarity<indexterm>
          <primary>clarity (need)</primary>
        </indexterm>. For repeating tasks, we do not want to re-invent the
      wheel every time so we make policy about how it is done. But we also do
      not want to determine, which circle member is going to take the task
      every time: that is why we define roles. This is both true for circle
      roles<indexterm>
          <primary>role</primary>

          <secondary>circle role</secondary>
        </indexterm> and for operational roles<indexterm>
          <primary>role</primary>

          <secondary>operational role</secondary>
        </indexterm>. It is inefficient to start every meeting having to
      determine who is facilitator<indexterm>
          <primary>facilitator</primary>
        </indexterm> or secretary for that meeting. We want to settle those
      roles so we can focus on what is relevant. Also, in defining a role, we
      give the person filling a role the authority<indexterm>
          <primary>authority</primary>

          <secondary>authority in role</secondary>
        </indexterm> to act without having to check back with the circle, and
      the person a chance to build expertise in that role. Roles in sociocracy
      are generally about empowerment, building expertise and paying
      attention.</para>

      <para>Some people see a circle as a bundle of operational roles in a
      domain – the holders of roles are the people who carry out the work of a
      circle. Another way of looking at it is to see all circle members as
      people who carry out the circle’s operations, while some repeating tasks
      live in roles. Either way, we are separating roles, like hats, from
      individuals. One person can wear many hats, but each hat can only be
      worn by one person. One circle member can hold many roles, depending on
      resources and skills. Ideally, we would like to see roles distributed
      among several people as this distributes power. (On rotating
      facilitation, or roles in general, see section <xref linkend="rotate"

              communication with people seeking information about membership.
              The leader makes sure this actually happens by checking in with
              people or doing whatever level of management is needed to make
              sure things happen smoothly. In that way, the leader pays
              attention to the whole.</para>
            </informalexample>Leadership<indexterm>
              <primary>leadership</primary>
            </indexterm> is absolutely essential. Without defined leadership,
          the circle can easily lack the person who pays attention to the
          whole and leads the circle forward. Leader-less circles can easily
          fade away and/or go into ‘‘coasting’’ mode (functioning but not
          moving forward). Remember that in a system of consent, the leader is
          not demanding circle members do things they do not want to do. It is
          not coercive leadership. Consent or sociocratic leadership is more
          like a running partner: the person who is paying attention to
          whether we show up and who checks in if we skip two running days in
          a row. This running partner does not have power<indexterm>

          The leader is the one who holds the operations<indexterm>
              <primary>operations</primary>
            </indexterm> and the members together, who is their accountability
          partner and their cheerleader. Because we have so much experience
          with the abuses of power, the reactions to leadership will depend on
          the organizational culture and context.</para>

          <para>It is not easy for leaders to find their place if they enter a
          sociocratic organization for the first time. We often experience
          leaders as rather cautious around stepping into this role. Despite
          it being an egalitarian governance system, sociocracy is perfectly
          compatible with strong leadership. In our view, strong leadership
          with good listening skills and a good mix of self-reflection and
          pragmatism is <emphasis role="from-text">service</emphasis> to the
          circle. It cannot be said often enough: in consent decision

              <secondary>consent and power</secondary>
            </indexterm> no person can be over-powered. If there is tension
          around leadership styles, remember three ways to smoothen out the
          tension: (1) building everyone’s communication skills, (2) giving
          each other feedback<indexterm>
              <primary>feedback</primary>
            </indexterm> and (3) defining the role or related policy<indexterm>
              <primary>policy</primary>
            </indexterm> better to create more clarity. We encourage an open
          conversation and reflection on how circle members feel about
          leadership. It can be an enlightening process to define together in

          <para>Each circle selects a delegate to participate in the
          parent/next-broader circle. The delegate attends the meetings of the

          be heard.</para>

          <para>Whose opinions and needs does a delegate represent? Their own
          or the circle’s? Their own. A circle selects a delegate for their
          capacity to work effectively as a member of the parent

              <primary>circle</primary>

              <secondary>parent circle</secondary>
            </indexterm>. The delegate makes sure that policies that the
          parent circle makes will work well in the child circle. The delegate
          might not have any operational responsibilities in the parent
          circle.</para>

          <para>Since the leader is also a member of the parent circle, there
          are now two members from each circle on the parent circle. Hearing

            <para>Since the skill set of a leader is very different from the
            skill set of a facilitator, sociocracy separates those two roles
            so that we are intentional about filling them each on the basis of
            their own requirements. We might have someone in your circle who
            is good at <emphasis role="from-text">both</emphasis> leading and
            facilitation<indexterm>
                <primary>facilitation</primary>
              </indexterm>, but there are many examples of great leaders who
            do not enjoy facilitation and of great facilitators who have a
            hard time leading operational work. The leader role typically asks
            for a person who is a doer, who is good at holding people
            accountable, delegating and paying attention to what
            needs<indexterm>
                <primary>needs</primary>
              </indexterm> to be done on a broad level while not losing track
            of details. A facilitator has to be comfortable in front of the
            group, paying attention to process so equivalence<indexterm>
                <primary>equivalence</primary>
              </indexterm> can be ensured during the meetings. A facilitator
            should be good at listening and synthesizing. Also, it makes sense
            that the leader has free attention to attend to content during the
            meeting while the facilitator holds the process level.</para>

          <para>Imagining a machine maintenance circle in a printing business,
          a role could hold attention for a special printing machine, its

          outreach efforts. If this proves successful, and if that is a

        role="from-text">necessarily</emphasis> have to be members of the
        circle that owns the role but it is recommended in order to more
        easily receive and respond to feedback. The limit here is the circle’s

          </indexterm>role description. A role description can be generated in

        operational role will operate according to circle policy and has
        exactly the authority they are given by the circle. They do not have
        the authority to make policy alone. Most typically, holders of roles

        <para>It is a good idea to have some system that creates redundancy
        (e.g. a second person who knows how to fix the copy machine!) so we do
        not depend on single individuals and skills, and knowledge can be
        spread. What is important here is that it has to be clear who is in
        charge. If two people hold a role, the risk is that they each assume
        the other one is responsible.</para>

        <para>A role description might look like example <xref

        have to do a selection process every four months which takes away from
        meeting time. We want to be intentional about how long a term we
        choose for selections. We can choose the terms separately every time
        we select and they can be different for every role. We can tailor our

          </indexterm>. Linkage is not only top-down and not only bottom-up
        but <emphasis>both</emphasis> at the same time. Information flows in
        an infinite loop from one circle to the next, in both directions. That
        also allows the circles to take care of each other if a circle
        struggles.</para>

          <title>Circular hierarchy</title>

          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>We need flow of information to make sure everyone and everything
        works well together. The two links also serve as a filter – no one in
        an organization can (and wants to) hold all the information from all
        the circles. Attention is a scarce resource and we have to protect it.
        That way, each circle can focus on what’s important to them. Only what
        is relevant is passed on. The top-down link filters information coming
        from the next-’higher’ circle and passes on everything that is
        relevant for this circle. The bottom-up link only reports what is
        important to the next-’higher’ circle and filters out details that are
        not relevant to know on that level.</para>

        <para>On the other hand, issues can also be amplified. For example,
        some regional work circles of the same organization might report a
        problem that does not seem to be huge on their scale – but the circle
        on the national level starts seeing a pattern that points to a
        systemic issue. We <emphasis role="from-text">want</emphasis> that
        kind of information to bubble up. A parent circle<indexterm>
            <primary>circle</primary>

            <secondary>parent circle</secondary>
          </indexterm> does not need to know who is performing what task
        within the circle. However, a circle might want to report to the
        parent circle that it is hard to find people to do extra tasks because
        all members of the circle are overcommitted. This might be a systemic
        issue that needs attention on a general level. It could also be that
        the IT solution that the organization is working with is too
        complicated and create a disconnect between people. This again would
        be important information. Decentralization and the
        filtering/amplification of information is a relief. Flow of
        information will not lead to overload.</para>

        <para>Historically, double-linking is one of the defining principles
        defining sociocracy (with linked circles, open elections, consent
        decision making). What we find in practice is that some groups choose
        to skip double-linking and only implement single links. Practitioners
        do not always see the need to implement double-linking<indexterm>

            <secondary>double-linking</secondary>
          </indexterm>, or they simply do not have the humanpower to fill all
        the roles. What we recommend is to strive for double-linking,
        especially on the highest levels (department circles<indexterm>
            <primary>circle</primary>

            <secondary>department circle</secondary>

          </indexterm> and to the mission circle<indexterm>
            <primary>mission circle</primary>
          </indexterm>). Double-linking is a <emphasis
        role="from-text">strategy</emphasis> to support equivalence in an
        organization. Below are some of the considerations around the topic of
        double-linking:</para>

        <para><itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If more than one person knows what is going on in a
              related circle (higher, or lower), then this increases the
              likelihood that we will have access to information from that
              circle even if members miss meetings due to travel etc.
              Double-linking helps keep the organization together: if the
              leader<indexterm>
                  <primary>leader</primary>
                </indexterm> is not present, the <indexterm>
                  <primary>delegate</primary>
                </indexterm>delegate will know what is going on in the other
              circle. If the delegate<indexterm>
                  <primary>delegate</primary>
                </indexterm> is absent, the leader will know.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>In a context where members participate in two or more
              other circles of the same organization, we might pass on formal

                  <secondary>double-linking</secondary>
                </indexterm>, knowing that we will always have enough
              information from more than one person in the room.
              Double-linking is critical for any circles that link to the
              Mission Circle or General Circle. At these levels, having only a
              single link may result in too little or distorted information
              sharing and a decrease in equivalence<indexterm>
                  <primary>equivalence</primary>
                </indexterm>. At lower levels of the organization,
              particularly in organizations where volunteers serve on multiple
              circles, there may be enough information flow.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>

          <para>Especially if we come from a domain where it is common to have
          board-run organizations, there is a noteworthy difference in
          sociocracy. Separating the operational level (general
          circle<indexterm>
              <primary>general circle</primary>
            </indexterm> and the circles under the general circle) from the
          mission-keeping level (mission circle) creates a clean distinction
          between every-day business and longer-term focus. Both are essential
          to run a successful organization but they have different angles on
          what is happening and are therefore best kept separate.</para>

          <para>The short answer is: yes. The long answer is: we might start
          out with only work circles and a general circle, but over time,
          there will be questions we won’t get around to talking about. An
          organization easily gets tied up in pressing issues. We don’t want
          to give in to “tyranny of the urgent over the important”. There will
          always be something urgent to deal with – but without taking the
          time to reflect and set a direction, we will lose out in the long
          run. Not only does the organization need direction but also
          adjustment and steering because the outside world changes
          continually. It is false economy to omit time devoted to
          conscientious steering.</para>

              secretary, leader and delegate are not implemented for the sake
              of formality, they are implemented for accountability, full
              transparency, to save time and to keep good records. (See box in

        <para>It is ok if a circle only meets from time to time, as long as
        this works well for the circle members guiding their work. For
        example, a circle that prepares the spring and fall fundraising events
        for a school might meet frequently as the event approaches, once
        afterwards and then not at all for a while.</para>

        <para>What can we do if we need to close down one or more circles? It
        is easy to do so if we drop the work at the same time. For example,

        <title>Hand-offs and handovers</title>

        <para>What’s the relationship between sibling circles? There should
        not be any overlap between their domains. But we might want to
        strengthen the connection between sibling circles when domains seem to
        interdepend. Let’s look at an example.</para>

        <para>Let’s say we have two circles in a land shepherdship context.
        One circle takes care of the paths, roads and infrastructure –
        Infrastructure Circle for short. Another circle takes care of the
        trees and bushes, Tree Circle.</para>

        <figure xml:id="branchexample1">
          <title>The circles with (supposedly) well-defined, non-overlapping
          domains</title>

              <imagedata fileref="branchexample1JH.jpg" width="100%"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>It seems that the <indexterm>
            <primary>domain</primary>
          </indexterm>domains are very well defined. Everything that is a road
        is in the Infrastructure Circle, for example repairs or cleaning and
        clearing the paths. Tree circle’s domain is also very well defined
        because we know the piece of land and we have a clear sense of what a
        tree is. If a tree is damaged, tree circle is going to look into
        it.</para>

        <para>Now, what happens if there is a storm and a branch breaks off
        the tree and falls onto the path? Who cleans up? There is no right or
        wrong here, but what we need is clarity between domains. Someone will
        have to be in charge, make policies around how the clean-up happens
        and what the budget<indexterm>
            <primary>budget</primary>
          </indexterm> is for additional machinery that might be necessary
        etc. This group might decide that the branch is in Tree Circle’s
        domain as long as it is on the tree. Once a branch is not attached to
        the tree anymore and blocks a path, it falls into Infrastructure
        Circle. It would be responsible for clean-up because it is in its
        domain to keep the paths usable. So far, this example is well along
        the lines of what we have said about clearly defined domains in
        section <xref linkend="domains"
        xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>.</para>

        <para>If this is a big piece of land and tree branches fall often,
        shouldn’t both circles be involved in policy around that? Shouldn’t
        they be <emphasis role="from-text">connected</emphasis> diagonally so
        that Infrastructure Circle is well-informed which trees are already
        weak and might fall soon? There are good reasons to create a
        connection between circles for sharing information, but not shared
        decision making.</para>

              member from active to inactive. The difference in membership
              status might come with a change in the membership fee (inactive
              members paying a different amount than active members). The
              change in status would have to have a clear hand-off from the
              circle that handles membership to the circle that handles
              finances so the new membership fees can be tracked
              correctly.</para>

          <para>Another membership-related example from a school context could
          be the transition from prospective student to an actual
          member.<informalexample>
              <para>Let’s imagine a school has a Public Relations (PR) circle
              that does PR and curates a mailing list of people who are
              considering sending their child to that school. The school also
              has an internal mailing list of news for parents of the school.
              We do not want the prospective parents to keep receiving
              irrelevant emails, and we do not want school parents to be hit
              by promotional emails. That means, as a prospective parent turns
              into a school parent, someone has to take their name off one
              list and add it to the other. The mailing list for prospective
              school families might be in the <indexterm>
                  <primary>domain</primary>
                </indexterm>domain of PR circle, and they would have to take
              the name off and let the curators of the school internal list
              know that a family has joined the school community.</para>

          <para>It is easy to confuse hand-offs with handovers. What’s a
          handover? A handover is when authority is being transferred to a
          different circle, on a temporary or permanent basis.</para>

          <para>For example, let’s say fallen branches are in the domain of
          Infrastructure Circle. A big storm happens and there is a lot of
          damage to the property. Infrastructure Circle might want to hand
          over the authority<indexterm>
              <primary>authority</primary>
            </indexterm> for all the broken branches and fallen trees on the
          paths to the Tree Circle. Now, on a temporary basis, Tree Circle
          consents to dealing with the clean-up while Infrastructure is busy
          doing other things. They are helping out but they have all authority
          to do so. Obviously, this requires trust and good coordination. If a
          handover is permanent, it will be manifest in a change of domains.
          In such a case, the definition of the aims would be changed so that
          all fallen trees and branches are now in Tree Circle’s
          domain.</para>

            <secondary>diagonal linking</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>The term ‘‘linking’’<indexterm>
              <primary>linking</primary>
            </indexterm> usually refers to linking through member(s) being
          full members with consent rights<indexterm>
              <primary>consent</primary>

              <secondary>consent rights</secondary>
            </indexterm> in both circles. This is not the case in a hand-off.
          There is no member of Infrastructure Circle that gets selected to be
          on Tree Circle. Diagonal ‘‘linking’’ is unnecessary since we can use
          hand-offs. Diagonal linking also waters down the advantages of
          sociocratic circle structures and creates unnecessary confusion. One
          of the advantages of small, linked circles is that everyone is part
          of the circle who matches the <indexterm>
              <primary>domain</primary>
            </indexterm>domain and the specificity of their work. If we link
          diagonally (full members of sibling circles), we might end up with a
          situation where that link does not find the entire meeting of the
          sibling circle relevant because their work is not in that circle’s
          domain – they are just there to listen in case “their” topic comes
          up. That is not an efficient use of time. Nothing keeps us from
          inviting the delegate or leader of another circle to <emphasis
          role="from-text">visit</emphasis> a circle if necessary, and that
          way, we can make sure we can keep things relevant for that visitor
          (for example by putting ‘‘their’’ agenda<indexterm>
              <primary>agenda</primary>
            </indexterm> item first so they can leave after). A visitor does
          not have consent rights<indexterm>
              <primary>consent</primary>

              <secondary>consent rights</secondary>
            </indexterm> in your circle. If we have a visitor from the same
          circle often because their presence is important for many meeting
          agenda<indexterm>
              <primary>agenda (meeting agenda)</primary>
            </indexterm> items of your circle, then your domains might need
          some refinement. Another option is to set up a helping
          circle<indexterm>
              <primary>helping circle</primary>
            </indexterm> that supports the interaction between two non-related

          <para>We may have some diagonal cross-pollination here and there

        <para>It can be useful, within organizations, to have gatherings that
        serve for skill building and information sharing. They can meet once
        or they can be permanent groups. We call any cluster of people within
        an organization that shares an interest (in addition to/separate from
        their circle work) an interest group or community of practice. The
        participants of an interest group may come from multiple departments
        or external interest groups. They can be formal, like a caucus that is
        lobbying or raising awareness within the organization, or they can be
        informal like an annual gathering of all single dads among the parents
        of a school. They can also be more like communities of practice – a
        group of people with similar roles that meets on a regular basis. What
        all gatherings have in common is that they don’t have a domain.
        Confusion can arise from the lack of clarity about the difference
        between circles and gatherings/communities of practice. Diagram <xref
        linkend="networkvscircle" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> shows the
        difference between an interest group and a formal circle.</para>

        <para>A gathering or interest group/community of practice cannot make
        decisions that impact the policies in the organization; of course,
        they can provide information and work out proposals to hand to the
        circles that hold the relevant domain.</para>

            <primary>facilitation</primary>
          </indexterm> (because that can only be decided by the circles
        themselves or by the circle that holds this domain in the
        organization). They can decide for themselves how they meet, but not
        for others outside their interest group. What they <emphasis
        role="from-text">can</emphasis> do is work out a recommendation
        together that might be consented to by each circle. They can train
        each other or learn together.</para>

        <para>A community of practice<indexterm>

        they relate to that circle’s domain, or write proposal drafts to
        submit to individual circles. However, we do not want to turn our
        interest groups<indexterm>
            <primary>interest group</primary>
          </indexterm> into ‘‘shadow’’ circles or secret clubs. If we meet

            <primary>minutes (meeting minutes)</primary>

        attention to being transparent and forthcoming. If there is a lot of
        energy around a topic, groups can consider making it a sub-circle or
        helping circle with all the usual features so they can benefit from
        the accountability and transparency that sociocratic design principles
        bring.</para>

          <para>The success of those efforts is highly dependent on the level

          <emphasis role="from-text">recommendations</emphasis> for the
          connected partner organizations. If those partner organizations are
          sociocratic (meaning they cannot be controlled by the hub through
          top-down decision making because even the CEO of a sociocratic
          organization who might be part of the hub cannot make policy
          decisions top-down), then those partner organizations are
          autonomous. If the hub works out a plan that is in line with the
          partner organization’s aim, and the effort seems worthwhile, there
          will probably be support to adopting recommendations by consent
          within each partner organization.</para>

          <para>While networks are for information-sharing and collective

          Networked organizations do not have to negotiate domains as they are
          each autonomous. If different organizations decide to become member
          organizations of a bigger organization, then they will share aim and
          domain and become semi-autonomous. Organizations now play the role
          of circles or of members in circles. In this set-up, there <emphasis

          example, once a set of sovereign countries passes on authority to an
          umbrella entity – like it was done when the European Union was
          formed – they are not a HUB but a federation because there are

          <para>Those organizations are all autonomous but they might choose

          <para>Global organizations often want a geographical structure mixed

          factors:<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>We want to strengthen the bond within and between local,

              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>What we need then is a combination of topical and
          geographical circles. The geographical circles are either

            </indexterm> circle (in <xref linkend="geographicaltopical2"

          there is between and momentum in, the topical and the geographical
          circles. To strengthen cohesion, we can make a requirement that at
          least leader and delegate from every geographical circle at a
          certain level be a member of a topical circle as well.</para>

          <para>The idea behind these structures is to pay attention both to
          local peer support and to building expertise. Staying in
          geographical silos can mean doubling work and re-inventing the wheel
          (e.g. if every regional organization has to come up with their own
          mailing list). Topical representation can add experience that can
          spread into all the circles (e.g. in shared databases supported by
          the topical circles but open to all member organizations). People
          with a strong interest on a topical level but without a local group
          can still join. People with a strong interest on the local level
          will benefit without being isolated.</para>

    perform operations, deciding how to interpret policy that guides our tasks
    or coordinating operations with each other. Operational decisions are made
    by anyone with the authority to make that decision.</para>

    <para>Policy is made to frame, guide and support operations. It is made by
    the <emphasis role="from-text">circle</emphasis> for <emphasis

    together by equivalence.</para>

    <para>Some circles are operations-heavy (more time spent doing work, less
    time spent in policy meetings), some circles are policy-heavy (more time
    spent in meetings, less on concrete tasks). The ratio between operations
    and policy only depends on the nature of the circle.<indexterm>

          <secondary>role description</secondary>

        <para>On the one hand, making policy takes time and creates overhead

            <secondary>trust</secondary>
          </indexterm>. As such, policy is both constraining and freeing: it
        frees people by creating a clear frame in which they have freedom to
        act, and it constrains the options of how things can be done.</para>

        <para>Each circle has to find its own balance. This might be an
        enlightening question to ask our circle in an evaluation: are we
        operating within the sweet spot between limitation, clarity, trust and
        choice?</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Case-by-case and general decisions</title>

        <para>A policy typically creates enough structure to be useful but it
        will leave some room for operational decisions. In the example of the
        outreach manager, the decision of whether your team sends a newsletter
        to prospective members at 8.30 am or at 4.45 pm might be a
        case-by-case decision and might be decided differently every time a
        newsletter goes out. As such, operational decisions are case-by-case
        decisions, interpreting the aim and policy (“send out a newsletter”)
        and making choices to complete the task (<emphasis
        role="from-text">“ok, I’ll do it this afternoon”</emphasis>).</para>

        <para>The organization might realize that sending the email newsletter
        in the morning makes it more likely to be opened and read by their
        addressees. In that case, the circle might review the data and decide
        that all future newsletters should be sent out before 9 am. This is a
        policy decision. Without that policy, by operational decisions, the
        newsletter might have been sent out in the morning one week and in the
        afternoon the next week. Policy limits choices.</para>

        <para>We sometimes call policy decisions “bulk decisions” because
        instead of making a case-by-case decision, a policy sets a frame for
        all similar decisions falling under that policy.</para>

        <para>An analogy is to consider all the operations (tasks being done
        in a circle) as water flowing down a river. The water flows within the
        river bed (the domain<indexterm>
            <primary>domain</primary>
          </indexterm>) toward a destination (the aim<indexterm>
            <primary>aim</primary>
          </indexterm>).<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>We might take some water out of the river with a bucket
              here and there and pour that water somewhere else. This is like
              a case-by-base (operational) decision<indexterm>
                  <primary>decision</primary>

                  <secondary>operational decision</secondary>
                </indexterm>.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Policy, on the other hand, is like building a pipe for
              irrigation. We are making a <emphasis role="from-text">general
              decision</emphasis> on how we want part of the water to flow. A
              pipe will have significant impact but it will also require
              effort to build and maintain.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>We would only build a pipe if it seems worth the
        effort. In the same way, a circle will only make policy where it
        contributes to getting work done. Do not build pipes where there is no
        water, or where working with a bucket is enough at the moment.</para>

        <para>Note: Operations<indexterm>
            <primary>operations</primary>

            <secondary>operations vs. policy</secondary>
          </indexterm> and policy<indexterm>
            <primary>policy</primary>

            <secondary>policy vs. operations</secondary>
          </indexterm> are not a binary distinction but two ends of a
        continuum. If we make policy for only a small number of situations, or
        case-by-case decisions for a set of situations, then the difference
        between operational decisions and policy decisions can blur. As an
        example, we might make policy about planning an event before we know
        how many parties will happen. In that case, making policy (roles,
        guidelines etc.) might be overdone and simple operational
        (case-by-case) decisions might be a better choice. If we project that
        there will be a lot to coordinate or that the party will become a
        regular event, creating policy might be useful.</para>

                lack of shared information and ideas. And the reaction to
                autocratic decisions is limited to submission or
                rebellion.</para>

                of something or someone. The standard is a simple majority
                rule with 50%+1 of the votes. With plurality voting, the
                candidate with the most votes is elected to office, even if
                their vote total is less than 50%. There are also different
                levels of supermajority vote that refine majority
                vote.<indexterm>

                <para>We are used to considering majority vote “fair”.
                Majority vote is fast and can be done easily with very many
                people and little information. Downsides: majority vote means
                that up to 49.9% of the group will be ignored – tyranny of the
                majority. We are likely to miss additional information from
                the people who vote against (<emphasis
                role="from-text">or</emphasis> in favor), with an uncertain
                level of buy-in. Voting rewards divisive behavior because the
                focus can easily become about winning, not about making a good
                decision.</para>

                well in small, homogenous groups. It is hard to scale to a
                larger group or organization and can be time-consuming and
                frustrating in groups where needs and expectations differ. The
                hidden cost in consensus is that the voices of those who want
                to move forward may be ignored when decisions are blocked.

            <secondary>consent vs. consensus</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>A colleague, Gregory Rouillard, said: <emphasis
          role="from-text">There is no consensus around consensus</emphasis>.
          It is hard to compare consensus and consent because consensus is not
          clearly defined. For some people, consensus is used like consent.
          That happens when people are willing to agree on a consensus
          decision even if the proposal<indexterm>
              <primary>proposal</primary>
            </indexterm> is not their personal preference<indexterm>
              <primary>personal preference</primary>
            </indexterm>. But that is not something we can guarantee if
          consensus is not defined as such (and if it were, then consensus
          would equal consent). Consensus can be <emphasis
          role="from-text">practiced</emphasis> like consent but does not
          <emphasis role="from-text">have</emphasis> to be practiced that
          way.</para>

          <para>It is less ambiguous to compare unanimity<indexterm>
              <primary>unanimity</primary>

              <see>consensus</see>
            </indexterm> and consent. If we ask for unanimous decisions, we
          ask <emphasis role="from-text">“do you agree?”,</emphasis> this
          question tends to focus people on their personal preferences. In
          consent, we ask <emphasis role="from-text">“do you
          object?”</emphasis> and this question includes both the range of
          tolerance<indexterm>
              <primary>range of tolerance</primary>
            </indexterm> and the personal preference.<indexterm>
              <primary>personal preference</primary>
            </indexterm></para>

          <para>We don’t see consent as a watered-down version of consensus.
          In our experience, consent shifts the energy towards doing, instead
          of convincing others of our own viewpoint. To focus on the range of
          tolerance instead of personal preferences means to acknowledge that
          people’s experiences and perspectives are different and might remain
          different. With consent, we can still operate together, guided by a
          shared aim.</para>

          <para>Instead, one can see consent decision-making as an organized,
          structured form of consensus. It is replicable and supports all
          voices being heard more effectively.</para>

          <para>Some groups work with “weighted” statements, like numbers to
          show the level of their support or disagreement to save time, or
          they introduce “concerns” in addition to objections. To us, the
          system is binary with exactly two options: either we consent or we
          object. There is no difference between a concern and an objection,
          and no difference between an objection and a paramount
          objection.</para>

          <para>Why? All facets of opinions are heard at an earlier point in

              <primary>reaction round</primary>

              <secondary>quick reaction round</secondary>
            </indexterm>. While our opinions might be multi-faceted with
          layers and nuances, the <emphasis
          role="from-text">outcome</emphasis> is binary: either we address the
          objection<indexterm>
              <primary>objection</primary>
            </indexterm> or we do not. If we raise a “concern” instead of an
          objection, we are putting the decision whether or not to integrate
          our concern on the circle. We prefer for circle members to take
          responsibility whether or not they would like to integrate their
          concern.</para>

          <para>Neither do we allow for people to pass or abstain in consent
          decisions. Why not? Let’s look at possible reasons that could lead a
          circle member to abstain:<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>The circle member might have a concern without bringing
                it up. In that case, the group (ideally the facilitator) will
                try to surface the objection.<indexterm>

                  </indexterm></para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>The circle member might not know enough about the
                proposal<indexterm>
                    <primary>proposal</primary>
                  </indexterm> to consent. In that case, ideally, the circle
                member should get access to all relevant information. In a
                system of distributed power, the people in those decentralized
                circles <emphasis role="from-text">need</emphasis> to take
                charge of their <indexterm>
                    <primary>domain</primary>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>The circle member might not care. That’s ok. What is
                important to understand is that <emphasis role="from-text">not
                caring</emphasis> means <emphasis role="from-text">not having
                an objection</emphasis>. In that case, it is better to say
                <emphasis role="from-text">“I have no objection”</emphasis>,
                but we do not abstain. We are actively choosing not to invest
                more time into the issue – perfectly fine but a choice that
                comes with responsibility.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>The circle member might not really understand the
                proposal in depth but might trust the rest of the circle.
                Since we operate on – to some extent – partial information at
                all times, not understanding something at depth is not a
                dealbreaker. If we choose to not object and not to ask for
                more information, then we are consenting because we don’t
                object.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>

          <para>Issues expressed but unaddressed can create a toxic group
          culture. Imagine someone consents to a proposal after raising a
          concern. They skip any attempt to integrate their concern into the
          proposal but insist on having their concern noted in the minutes. If
          the action then generated by the proposal is unsuccessful then the
          person who raised the concern might say “I told you so!”. Note that
          in this example, everyone in the circle heard the concern and
          everyone (including the member raising the concern) consented.
          Everyone is equally responsible for the decision made. Consent is
          not about being right, but about making decisions together that the
          circle considers safe enough.</para>

          <para>Abstaining from a decision will create the same dynamics.
          Every circle member is 100% responsible for the business of the
          circle. We <emphasis role="from-text">want</emphasis> the
          information on the table, and we want to encourage a culture where
          people are comfortable to object. If there is any reason to object
          or to ask for more information, any circle member is required to do
          so. For all other cases, step up and consent – consent decision
          making also means “no excuses”.</para>

          <para>Note that by consent, we can decide to use any other method of
          decision making. For example, we can, by consent to take a
          vote.<indexterm>
              <primary>decision-making</primary>

              <secondary>method</secondary>
            </indexterm> By choosing to vote, one would intentionally accept
          that some voices might be ignored, for example for the sake of
          saving time. Having more variety in our decision making is useful if
          we are intentional about our choices and its advantages and
          disadvantages.<indexterm>

            <secondary>valid objection</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>Assessing whether an objection is valid can easily turn into a
          power struggle. It does not make sense to make decisions by consent
          (defined as “no objections”) and to shift the power to someone who
          then decides what counts as an objection. If there is a judge
          needed, there cannot be equivalence.</para>

          <para>In our experience, when following the process described in
          this manual, this question does not arise. By default, every
          objection is valid as soon as it is expressed. As a circle, we can
          then explore whether we see the proposal interfering with the
          circle’s aim. When people have trust that they will be considered
          and when they understand the difference between personal preference
          and range of tolerance, the question of whether an objection is
          valid or not does not apply. That said, we aim not to engage in
          “people-pleasing” (fine-tuning a proposal until everyone gets their
          preference).</para>

          <para>Back to the example of cooking a meal, the same pattern
          applies. Let’s say we are cooking for a large number of people. The
          day before, we might make a list of ingredients based on a recipe
          and buy those ingredients. The day of the cooking event, we
          double-check whether all ingredients are there. Then we look at the
          recipe again and plan what order to do the steps in and how long it
          might take. Now we cook the ingredients into a meal. After we have
          completed all the steps, we look at the food and wonder whether it
          is done now. We check the consistency, taste and temperature to
          prepare for the output. Then we plan the serving. Bowls or deep
          plates? Any decoration? We now serve the food and for a second, our
          eyes wander around, checking whether all is complete as the meal is
          about to begin.</para>

          <para>These are steps that we go through naturally. The need to
          define the steps explicitly is higher if the process consists of
          more parts, for example, if the person/group who buys the
          ingredients is different from the group that cooks and different
          from the servers, or if we need to order wholesale food in large
          quantities with an entire workflow instead of a simple shopping
          trip. We need to have a clean process in place or there will be

          <para>For decision making, a group has to think together. All minds
          have to be connected and synchronized, while allowing for creativity
          and people’s own way of thinking. There are a lot of different
          layers playing together on top of the content of our decision:
          process, interpersonal issues, internalized patterns, personal
          style, performance issues (distractions etc.). The more people
          participate, the more things happen simultaneously. Shared
          exploration and decision making is a complicated and complex
          endeavor. A good and clear system will help.</para>

            <para>All the steps in decision making fall into smaller steps,
            like fractals: as soon as we zoom in with a magnifying glass onto

            – decide</emphasis> again. The more in-between steps we consider,
            the more intentional and effective we can be. The fractal nature
            is shown in figure <xref linkend="MDFJHdecisionmakinginbetween"
            xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>. Each step now correlates to (a
            set of) rounds (people in the circle speaking in turn) – which
            makes facilitation in this format very simple. With many small
            rounds, each with a well-defined question and scope, every circle
            member can focus on the content at hand.</para>

        <title>The three phases of policy process</title>

        <para>In this book, we will refer to the entire process of making
        policy decisions as ‘‘policy process’’, while the last phase
        (consenting to a proposal) is called ‘‘consent process’’<indexterm>
            <primary>consent process</primary>
          </indexterm>. For every step, we are giving the <emphasis
        role="from-text">intention</emphasis> (lead), the <emphasis
        role="from-text">tools</emphasis> (do/path) and the measure for
        telling when a step is complete (<emphasis role="from-text">complete
        when</emphasis>). In the following sections, we will go through every
        phase with lots of detail. The detail is intended to support groups in
        gaining clarity and choice, not to be prescriptive.</para>

        <para>Please note that we see the processes described here, based on
        the classic steps of <emphasis role="from-text">input – transformation
        – output</emphasis>, are compatible with ‘‘classic’’ sociocracy and
        with different flavors of sociocracy, for example, Sociocracy
        3.0<indexterm>
            <primary>Sociocracy 3.0</primary>
          </indexterm>). There are many ways to use and name the process. The
        contribution in this manual is in listing and explaining the <emphasis
        role="from-text">intention, tools</emphasis> and <emphasis
        role="from-text">measures</emphasis> explicitly. If groups deviate in
        nomenclature or in what tools they prefer, we want to make sure the
        process integrates equivalence<indexterm>
            <primary>equivalence</primary>
          </indexterm> and effectiveness<indexterm>
            <primary>effectiveness</primary>
          </indexterm>. Especially if groups deviate from what the
        international community has found to be useful practice over time, we
        recommend stepping back from time to time and reviewing whether the
        tweaked process is delivering what is desired.</para>

          <title>Understanding the need</title>

          <para>We start the policy process by understanding the issue that
          lies under the trigger that brought a topic to our circle. That
          trigger could be a complaint, or an accident, a drop in sales, or
          the desire to achieve more. A trigger event points to a deeper need.
          Before strategizing how to better meet the underlying need
          effectively, everyone needs to understand it. It can get frustrating
          when, half-way into the policy generation process, we realize we
          still do not have clarity about the context, trigger or need. The
          understanding phase ends with a written or verbally stated “needs
          statement” that summarizes how the circle understands the issue and
          needs on the table. The three-step process here is to:<itemizedlist>

                  prevent similar events from happening. This is especially
                  true when it is about behavior: much too often, policy is

            <para>If we think about dimensions first, our group will be more

            before emotions get high. It is often astonishing how many good
            questions come up during picture forming. Starting with opinions
            can easily distract a group from seeing the issue as a whole.
            Picture forming offers a phase where we focus on understanding the
            field before zooming in on solutions.<informalfigure

              </informalfigure>Also, it is helpful for a group to start with
            something that connects them. For example, if we are debating
            accountability of dog owners, there might be very different
            opinions and <emphasis role="from-text">strategies</emphasis> to
            address it. However, everyone will agree that <emphasis
            role="from-text">something</emphasis> needs to be said about
            “leashes/no leashes” in a policy about dogs in a community;
            everyone will agree that “leashes/no leashes” is a dimension of
            any complete proposal on this topic (see example <xref
            linkend="dogpolicy"
            xrefstyle="select: labelnumber page"/>).</para>

            <para>Circle members may explain a bit about the background of
            their dimension. It helps, for example, to name two options
            (<emphasis role="from-text">“do we do A or B?”</emphasis>). See
            example <xref linkend="examplegeneratingproposalpictureforming"
            xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> for illustration. An experienced
            group will gather keywords fairly quickly, within a few minutes.
            Groups get better with experience. The best way to learn picture
            forming is by example. If the group is new to the process, then
            someone with experience might model by giving their own dimensions
            before asking for the group’s suggestions. With inexperienced
            groups, we might have to explain more and perhaps extract
            dimensions from opinions they share.</para>

            <para>Caution: if there are a lot of dimensions, we might be
            dealing with a question that is too big. We will get way too many
            proposal ideas and might get overwhelmed. In that case, we can
            divide up the dimensions into related chunks and deal with them
            separately or form a helping circle<indexterm>
                <primary>helping circle</primary>
              </indexterm> to prepare the next phase.</para>

            <para>For this step, we want to keep in mind that we are looking
            for a solution within a reasonable amount of time that works for
            everyone (i.e. that lies within everyone’s range of
            tolerance<indexterm>
                <primary>range of tolerance</primary>
              </indexterm>). We are writing down a proposal early because that
            is what gets the group to the next level instead of continuing a
            conversation about personal preferences. We put out a proposal so
            we can surface objections (if there are any) sooner than
            later.</para>

            <para>In the quick reactions round, everyone gets a chance to give
            their opinion on a proposal. It is important for every
            contribution to be brief. Five sentences or less is what a group
            should be aiming for. If someone has an objection<indexterm>
                <primary>objection</primary>
              </indexterm> they will have more time to speak later!</para>

                <listitem>
                  <para>Some groups prefer doing two separate rounds: one for
                  emotional reactions (“reactions”), and one for improving the
                  proposal (“solutions round”; see Fig. <xref

              <para>Never skip the step completely. The minimal version is to
              ask <emphasis role="from-text">“is there anything you’d like to
              say before we’re moving to the consent round?”</emphasis></para>

            <para>Note: the measure is <emphasis

              </indexterm>, as we might lose time over irrelevant details.
            Instead, we move to consent. If we are not sure whether the group
            is ready, we just ask, for example by saying <emphasis
            role="from-text">“is there anything else that really needs to be
            said before we go to the consent round?”</emphasis> Here are some

                <secondary>passing in reaction rounds</secondary>
              </indexterm> because it is a useful temperature check. We get to
            hear what others think, where they are with the proposal, what it
            means to them and what their concerns are, which might not rise to
            the level of an objection<indexterm>
                <primary>objection</primary>
              </indexterm>. Especially on controversial topics, it is
            important to make sure that everyone has been heard sufficiently.
            However, it is also important to keep statements brief and
            relevant since it is most effective to devote time to addressing
            objections. Example <xref linkend="exampledecidingquickreactions"

            <para>Note how in <xref
            linkend="exampledecidingquickreactionswithobjection"
            xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>, the circle member summarizes
            the concern in one sentence. The objector-to-be knows he is going
            to be heard later, so one sentence is enough to give everyone a
            sense of where this is going. Just saying <emphasis
            role="from-text">“I will object”</emphasis> without giving any
            context might be unsettling for a group; but it is also not the
            right place to say a lot more than a few sentences, so keep it
            short!</para>

            <para>Also notice how the circle just continues with the process
            -- hearing that someone will object does not stop the round. For
            that reason, it is ok for the facilitator<indexterm>
                <primary>facilitator</primary>
              </indexterm> to move to the consent round<indexterm>
                <primary>consent round</primary>
              </indexterm>, trusting that the circle member will object and
            that the group will benefit from the discussion of objections one

            how to navigate them most effectively and efficiently.</para>

            <para>The advantage of a friendly amendment is clear: it can be a
            fast-track to an improved proposal. But there are
            disadvantages.<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Friendly amendments can prolong the process. Note that
                  friendly amendments change the proposal, sometimes in
                  unexpected ways. A circle member and the facilitator might
                  assume that an amendment they suggest is uncontradictory.
                  But for a third circle member, an innocent-looking amendment
                  might change how well the proposal works for them and they
                  might end up objecting to the proposal <emphasis
                  role="from-text">because</emphasis> of the amendment. In
                  that case, we have lost time because we will have to process
                  the objection.</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para>In a similar way, friendly amendments can create
                  frustration. Imagine a group having crafted a proposal very
                  carefully and thoroughly and then pieces of it get changed
                  “on the fly”. (Then again, ignoring friendly amendments can
                  create frustration as well.)</para>

                  <para>Accepting friendly amendments can create sloppiness

                        the consent process (present proposal, clarifying
                        questions etc.).</para>

              </itemizedlist>We recommend that the facilitator<indexterm>
                <primary>facilitator</primary>
              </indexterm> and no one else make the decision of what
            amendments are accepted in this phase. (Or the facilitator
            appoints someone to make that decision.) Ultimately, the
            facilitator is responsible for process during the meeting. Too
            many cooks will slow down the process with uncertain benefit. The
            facilitator’s task is to avoid confusion and to move the group
            along without cutting people off. If the facilitator is starting
            to feel uncomfortable with the process, ask for consent on the
            original proposal and then ask for new proposals that might build
            on the just-approved proposal. If someone is making a
            counter-proposal, we have to be even more alert. (See section

            <para>In example <xref linkend="exampledecidingreviewamendments"

            move to the consent round.</para>

            if it has not changed at all, just acknowledge that and move to
            the consent round. The more changes there were, the more important

        on – at the same time as publishing the policy – how the circle wants
        to receive feedback on that policy. For example, if the circle prefers
        feedback in a survey, then give access to the survey as soon as the
        policy is public. If there is a person identified for filling a role

        <section>
          <title>Shorten the term.</title>

          <para>If there is an objection to a policy proposal, one option to
          move forward is to shorten the term. If a circle member objects to a
          proposal, they might be willing to consent to trying it out for a
          shorter time. Oftentimes, this makes it easier for circle members to
          consent. This strategy works best in combination with the next
          strategy, <emphasis role="from-text">measure the concern</emphasis>.
          (See section <xref linkend="reviewingpolicy"
          xrefstyle="select: labelnumber page"/> on term ends for
          policy.)</para>

          <para>Shortening the term of a proposal means the policy will be
          revisited sooner. We will then see whether the policy brought
          negative changes and we can then adjust the policy. Therefore,
          shortening the term of a policy increases a circle’s willingness to
          experiment and innovate. The question changes from <emphasis
          role="from-text">“should we drop this proposal?”</emphasis> to
          <emphasis role="from-text">“would it feel safe enough to try it for
          3 months? 4 months?”</emphasis></para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Measure the concern</title>

          <para>An objection is not a reason to drop a proposal. How can we
          learn?</para>

          <para>In sociocracy, we broaden our view using another option:
          measure the concern. That means that we go ahead and try something
          (with everyone’s consent) but we put a measurement in place so that
          we don’t just hope for the best but actually know what the impact of
          our policy is.</para>

          <para><informalexample>
              <para>For example, a non-profit is looking for ways to reduce
              operational costs. Historically, they have sent out monthly
              newsletters. The proposal on the table is to reduce the
              frequency of newsletters to save money. A circle member
              expresses a concern that the click rate on the website might go
              down, leading to a decrease in donations. The circle does a
              quick reaction round<indexterm>
                  <primary>reaction round</primary>
                </indexterm> where everyone shares a reflection on the concern
              raised. The circle amends the proposal: by consent, they decide
              to go ahead with the reduction in publications, and at the same
              time perform a cost-benefit analysis. They want to find out if
              the savings generated by reducing the operational costs have a
              negative impact on donor generosity. They craft an additional
              proposal to measure and monitor the outcome of reducing the
              frequency of publications. The proposal includes:</para>

          happen. We find a way of trying it out. Since we are measuring the
          concern, we keep the risk as small as possible. In the same way as
          we might count clicks and donations, we can also count
          registrations, complaints, count clients or sales. Everything that
          cannot be counted can still be surveyed: members, staff, workshop
          participants, hosts, customers. Example <xref
          linkend="measuretheconcern" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> is an
          example of a shorter term and a measurement to see whether concerns
          are borne out. A habitual nay-sayer may consent if we take their

      <para>All policy is made to support circles in achieving their aims. The

      workflow<indexterm>
          <primary>workflow</primary>
        </indexterm> policies and the creation of roles. Roles are created to
      ‘‘package’’ operational tasks within a circle so that the attention and
      work will lie in the holder of the role instead of the whole circle. In
      order to move operations<indexterm>
          <primary>operations</primary>
        </indexterm> into a role, we need to take two steps:<orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Write a role description<indexterm>
                <primary>role</primary>

                <secondary>role description</secondary>
              </indexterm> and consent to it, thereby creating the
            role.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Select an individual into filling that role, also by
            consent.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>In some cases, both steps are taken at once to save
      time. For example, the proposal might be <emphasis role="from-text">“I
      propose that this task of staying connected to our fiscal sponsor be
      moved into a role of the fiscal sponsor coordinator for the next two
      years and that Aliyah fill that role for 6 months.”</emphasis></para>

      <para><emphasis role="from-text">Both</emphasis> decisions will come
      with a term. To create a role is a decision that needs to be reviewed on
      a regular basis, including whether it (still) needs to exist, what the
      tasks, limits and measures might be. At the same time, who fills a role
      is a decision that needs to be revisited when the term for that person
      is up. If there is no policy preventing it, any person can be
      re-elected<indexterm>

          <para>The policy-generating process, as described in section <xref

          encourages circles to make sure the need is fully understood before
          creating policy. The circle might understand the issue and
          underlying needs well enough and feel confident that a role might be
          the strategy that would meet their needs most effectively. Often,
          creating roles is one part of a larger policy context. This is true
          when a circle approves a general guideline <emphasis
          role="from-text">and</emphasis> creates a role to track measures for
          that guideline. For example if an office is deciding to introduce a
          new tool for customer relationship management, they might also want
          to create a role to oversee this process.</para>

        feedback so we can form a proposal. (3) Lastly, we decide about the
        proposal. In cases where there are objections, we deal with the
        objections until everyone can consent to the proposal. Figure <xref

            <para>It is important to end this process with a consent round. If
            there is an objection, we explore it and see if we can find a set
            of qualifications everyone can consent to.</para>

            <para>For example, in figure <xref linkend="qualifications"
            xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>, the item “long-standing member”
            for the delegate is not necessarily a qualification everyone will
            consent to. Someone might have suggested it, it gets written on
            the list, but we still need to see whether everyone can consent to
            that. <emphasis role="from-text">“Why do you want someone who is a
            long-standing member as a delegate?”</emphasis> Accordingly, we
            might decide that we want a facilitator with only little
            experience on the job because in that phase of the organization,
            we might want to put our attention to spreading <indexterm>
                <primary>leadership</primary>
              </indexterm>leadership and we are confident we can work with an
            inexperienced facilitator. As another example, in training
            contexts, often someone mentions the qualification <emphasis
            role="from-text">impartial</emphasis> for a facilitator<indexterm>
                <primary>facilitator</primary>

                <secondary>facilitator bias</secondary>
              </indexterm>. We, personally, would not consent to that, so this
            would give rise to an interesting discussion. (The reasons are
            that we do not think there is such a thing as an impartial circle
            member, and the double role – being circle member and facilitator
            at the same time – is a consequence of <emphasis
            role="from-text">self</emphasis>-governance. The way we look at
            it, the facilitator should be willing and able to separate their
            facilitator role and circle member role.)</para>

          <title>Can we select for more than one role at a time?</title>

          <para>Yes. This makes sense if your choices seem interdependent, for
          example if we want someone as facilitator but only if he or she is
          not a delegate. It also simply saves time. We can select all roles
          at the same time.</para>

          <para>How does this work? In the nomination round<indexterm>

          <para>The grid in diagram <xref linkend="complexselection"

          proposes someone for each of the roles along with the reasons why.
          If one of the roles is not as easy to fill, it may make sense to
          consent to the easier choice(s) and to focus afterward on the
          election that needs more attention.</para>

          <title>Why do we not ask for willingness first?</title>

          <indexterm>
            <primary>selection</primary>

            <secondary>willingness as a factor in selections</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>Whenever we teach this process, there is someone in the group
          that asks: <emphasis role="from-text">“why don’t we ask whether that
          person wants to do that role? How can we talk about them serving in
          a role if we don’t know whether they are available and
          willing?”</emphasis></para>

          <para>The first answer is that having the information reduces the
          possibilities we have. I (Jerry) was part of a group that had been
          working together and we were planning to select a facilitator. I had
          a clear preference for someone and spoke with that person ahead of
          time, and she shared with me that she was not available. In the
          formal selection process, everyone but me nominated her in the
          nomination round<indexterm>
              <primary>nomination</primary>
            </indexterm><indexterm>
              <primary>selection</primary>

              <secondary>nomination</secondary>
            </indexterm><indexterm>
              <primary>round</primary>

              <secondary>nomination round</secondary>
            </indexterm>, and she ended up being proposed as a candidate and
          consented to her own selection. Willingness, or lack thereof, may
          shift.</para>

          <para>It makes quite an impression to be told by circle members how
          qualified oneself is for a role. It is not unheard of that the
          individual selected says afterward: <emphasis role="from-text">“I
          would have never volunteered for this role, but I was convinced by
          the positive feedback I heard here. I feel honored to fill this
          role.”</emphasis> Note that this is not about forcing people into a
          role. We assume they know that they can say no – and the group needs
          to allow them that space. They consent to fill the role – which is
          an active process and very different from being volunteered by not
          saying <emphasis role="from-text">no</emphasis> loud enough! This
          process is designed to help people say yes and to create an
          opportunity of exploring what a <emphasis
          role="from-text">no</emphasis> means and how it could become a
          <emphasis role="from-text">yes</emphasis>.</para>

          <para>This is why it is best to start the consent round<indexterm>
              <primary>consent round</primary>
            </indexterm><indexterm>
              <primary>selection</primary>

              <secondary>consent round</secondary>
            </indexterm> so that the candidate speaks last. To achieve that,
          just start the round with the person next to the candidate and pass
          the round in the opposite direction. That way, the nominated person
          will get to hear everyone else first.</para>

          <para>A tricky question is the following: <emphasis
          role="from-text">“I am one of the people that keeps getting
          nominated, and understand that it is good to give feedback and I
          understand that people want me in a role. But I am over-committed in
          this organization. It is just a waste of time to even nominate me as
          I will object anyway.”</emphasis> Situations and statements like
          these are tricky, and we’d like to share our thoughts because we
          assume that what we have to say might be useful. First of all, the
          people who perceive themselves as overcommitted are often the same
          people that would like to hear more appreciation of their work. Can
          we hear this as feedback on how much people appreciate our
          contribution to our circle? The election process is more than just
          finding someone as quickly as possible to do the job. It can be a
          time for reflection too on how we spread the work. If we sit through
          nominations just seeing them as a waste of time, we are missing the
          wonderful message in it: <emphasis role="from-text">“we appreciate
          you”</emphasis>. Also, maybe more importantly, the fact that the
          same people are nominated again on a regular basis but then object
          because they are over-committed is very important feedback. What do
          we as a circle do with that? How do we interpret that? As a circle,
          do we think we could make better use of that member’s contribution?
          Maybe we could talk about their overall package of tasks in the
          circle. Maybe we can build more <indexterm>
              <primary>leadership</primary>
            </indexterm>leadership around the easier tasks that person is
          doing so we can free up time and attention for the more visionary
          work. Whatever we do with it, we want to be sure to notice the
          feedback this process gives us.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Why do not we just let people volunteer?</title>

            <secondary>volunteering for roles</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>The basis for the decision of who fills the role is
          qualification. A volunteer might not be the fit person for the job.
          And the best candidate might not volunteer! Filling roles on a
          volunteer basis will not get us reliably good results. (Willingness,
          of course, is <emphasis role="from-text">one</emphasis> factor. If
          someone <emphasis role="from-text">really</emphasis> does not want
          to fill a role, chances are they will not perform well in that
          role.)</para>

          <para>Inviting volunteers can get us into a lot of difficulties
          because it is difficult to object if volunteering is our method of
          decision making. The ability to object is important for
          collaboration. An organization is about <emphasis
          role="from-text">doing</emphasis> something. Whether or not someone
          is suitable for a role is essential for creating a good work
          environment.</para>

            <secondary>self-nomination</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>It is important to understand the difference between
          self-nominations and volunteering for a role. Self-nomination adds
          <emphasis role="from-text">information</emphasis> since
          self-nomination includes saying <emphasis
          role="from-text">why</emphasis> we nominate ourselves. What
          qualifications<indexterm>
              <primary>qualification</primary>
            </indexterm> do we see in ourselves? What does this role mean to
          us? There is much more to learn that we would ever hear if someone
          volunteered saying <emphasis role="from-text">“I can do
          it”.</emphasis> Self-nominations, like volunteering, express
          willingness, but being selected into that role does not happen
          automatically – the other circle members have to consent.</para>

          <para>The best way to show the difference is that we have seen it
          happen many times that people nominated themselves but were not
          selected. Or they nominated themselves in the nomination round but
          shifted their nomination to someone else in the change
          round<indexterm>

              <primary>selection</primary>

              <secondary>change round</secondary>
            </indexterm>.</para>

          <para>One tricky aspect around self-nominations is that in some
          cultures, it is not easy to self-nominate, either because those
          cultures are hierarchical (and some people will traditionally not
          expect to be allowed to self-nominate), or because they are
          extremely horizontal in which case self-nomination can look
          arrogant. We are aware of these patterns and still think that
          self-nominations are healthy if they are based on qualifications.
          Even apart from cultural background, self-nomination and changing
          the nomination from or to oneself require some practice, since those
          are tied to emotional baggage around how we see ourselves in the
          group. If it is possible, name those feelings and share them. The
          more information is on the table, the better the group will be able
          to hold it with care and respond to it if they choose to.</para>

          <para>We might find ourselves in a position where we are asked to
          consent or object to someone who is not our preference. It’s good to
          remind ourselves that in the nomination round<indexterm>
              <primary>nomination</primary>

              <secondary>nomination round</secondary>
            </indexterm>, we are being asked about your preference. In the
          consent round, however, we’re asked about our range of
          tolerance<indexterm>
              <primary>range of tolerance</primary>
            </indexterm>. We only object if we see our participation or the
          circle’s success impacted by that candidate filling that role. Does,
          for example, selecting Victor as a facilitator potentially harm the
          circle’s work/learning? If so, then we object. If not, then we
          consent. (On the emotional challenge of objecting to someone, see
          section <xref linkend="emotionalchallenges"
          xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>.)</para>

          <para><emphasis role="from-text">Never</emphasis> object based on a
          personal preference<indexterm>
              <primary>personal preference</primary>
            </indexterm>, for instance by saying <emphasis role="from-text">“I
          object to …being facilitator because I think that YY would be better
          in that role.”</emphasis> That is irrelevant information because we
          are not looking for the perfect candidate. Additionally, comparing
          people will shift the energy from an affirmative but honest process
          to a potentially harmful process.</para>

          <para>If there are objections, we do not give up right away, for
          example by nominating a different candidate. First, we check and see
          if there is a way to turn the <emphasis
          role="from-text">no</emphasis> into a <emphasis
          role="from-text">yes</emphasis>. We do so on the basis of the
          objection. For example, someone might have an objection because the
          candidate does not have enough experience, and the group has agreed
          when talking about the qualifications<indexterm>
              <primary>qualification</primary>
            </indexterm> that experience is an essential qualification in the
          circle’s current situation. In general, the three standard ways of
          integrating an objection apply to selections as well.<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Modify the proposal: what can we modify? For example, if
                we think someone needs more experience, we make an

                    <primary>amendment</primary>

                <para>Shorten the term: if, for example, one circle member is
                not convinced that someone is a good candidate to be

                <para>Measure the concern: what would we need to track so you

                reliable at preparing agenda items, how would we measure that
                this is true?</para>

                <para>Combinations thereof: what strategies can we combine?
                Following the examples mentioned, one might give the person
                extra training, track how well they are preparing agenda items
                and fill the role for a short term.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>We can follow the template for integrating
          objections; but at the very least, we would want to go in rounds. We
          try to tap into group wisdom and be gentle with each other, to find
          a good solution.</para>

          <para>If the nominee themselves objects, for example for lack of
          experience, we can remind them that the whole group had confidence
          in them, and ask what they would need to be able to say yes. Their
          objections are addressed in the same way as other circle members’
          objections.</para>

          <para>Another example: let’s assume an employee, Malik, works only
          part-time because he is taking care of his elderly mother. That does
          not affect how qualified Malik is as a delegate but it could come up
          in the form of an objection. Let’s imagine this is an international
          general circle<indexterm>
              <primary>general circle</primary>
            </indexterm> scheduled across different time zones so that
          meetings can only happen in the afternoon, but this employee needs
          to leave at 3 pm because that is when the home care person leaves.
          Let’s not forget that if we’re even discussing his candidacy, it
          means that Malik was nominated by his peers for good reasons, for
          example because he is a well-respected employee with excellent
          communication skills and this is exactly what the circle saw the
          need for. If someone objects (could also be Malik himself raising
          this objection), this is an opportunity to put all the information
          on the table. An open, transparent process is a better approach than
          either not considering him in the first place or pretending his time
          constraints do not exist. Accept the reality so we can work with it,
          not against it. Once it is in the open in the form of an objection,
          it is not Malik’s <emphasis role="from-text">flaw</emphasis> but
          instead, it is the shared responsibility and interest of the circle
          to explore options. In a place of shared power, there is plenty of
          space to find a creative solution. Could Malik work in his home
          office and we accept that there might be an occasional interruption?
          Maybe, the circle might be able to free him up on one morning a
          month, and he could switch schedules so that the monthly general
          circle meeting time is free? If there is no good way, don’t push too
          hard. Malik from our example was able to hear how much his skills
          are appreciated and he will feel the care for him in his
          situation.</para>

          <para>The facilitator can nominate someone else. Since the other
          nominations<indexterm>
              <primary>nomination</primary>
            </indexterm> are still on people’s minds, we don’t have to go

          proposal and go into a consent round.</para>

              <secondary>change round</secondary>
            </indexterm>, every round is going to take too long and the
          contributions people make will likely be repetitive. But we want to
          hear everyone’s input. What can we do? Here is one fairly easy
          tweak: everyone in the large group nominates a set number of people
          (for example 4) and writes their nomination on a sheet of paper.
          Then we ask the first person (let’s call them circle member 1) in
          the round who they nominated. They say the name of their first
          nomination<indexterm>
              <primary>nomination</primary>
            </indexterm>. We ask everyone else in the room who nominated that
          person as well to stand up (raise their hand). Then we ask circle
          member 1 to share why they nominated that person. Circle member 1
          shares their reasons, and we ask everyone who feels represented
          completely in what they heard to sit down/take their hand down. Then
          ask a circle member who is still standing to share their additional
          reasons for nominating the same person. Again, everyone who now
          feels represented completely by what has been shared can sit down.
          We do that until everyone sits. Then we ask circle member 2 to share
          who they nominated (can’t be the first nominee again but someone
          else on their list), and the whole process starts again until we
          have heard all the reasons and nominations, without any repetitions.
          We can do the same for the change round<indexterm>
              <primary>change round</primary>
            </indexterm><indexterm>

              <secondary>change round</secondary>
            </indexterm>, encouraging to only speak if there is new
          information. The rest is the same as the regular process: the
          facilitator makes a proposal and we can hear objections.</para>

          <para>We like getting this visual image of how many people nominated
          a nominee, and we get to hear all the reasons and at least some
          sense of how many people agree with those reasons as they sit down
          but we do not get any repetitions. Maybe not everyone will speak but
          everyone is represented and can speak if they do not feel completely
          represented either in <emphasis role="from-text">who</emphasis> they
          nominated or in <emphasis role="from-text">why</emphasis> they
          nominated that person. This is time-efficient, without redundant
          information.</para>

          <para>A variation: after the change round, we can put the 5 people

          process, two circle members would object and candidate A would not
          be selected. On the other hand, there would be no objection to

          <para>This scenario was designed to show the difference between

          valuable information in the form of objections. Sociocracy focuses

          In contexts where sociocratic decision making is not the accepted
          practice, there are variations on voting that are more inclusive
          than majority rule. Describing these is beyond the scope of this

          <para>The facilitator’s<indexterm>
              <primary>facilitator</primary>
            </indexterm> task is to get the group to come to a decision that
          everyone can work with. If that is true for both candidates, great.
          We can also say that. <emphasis role="from-text">“I am guessing that
          both candidates could get consent from the group which shows how
          much skill and trust we have in this group.”</emphasis> Then make a
          decision, and be specific in your reasoning. We can go back to the
          qualifications<indexterm>
              <primary>qualification</primary>

              <secondary>list of qualifications</secondary>
            </indexterm> and how we would prioritize them. For example, did we
          say we wanted to select someone who does not have a lot of
          experience yet? Then go with the least experienced candidate. Or is
          there another qualification that makes the difference? Always
          remember: we are looking to find a candidate that everyone can
          consent to. The task is <emphasis role="from-text">not</emphasis> to
          find the best candidate.</para>

          <para>We know it can be hard for groups to make a decision if it
          feels almost arbitrary and both candidates are good and respected.
          Split decisions are paralysing so any way out of a split decision is
          better than paralysis. We invite readers to think about it not in
          terms of fairness. If we try to make it fair, there is hardly a good
          way out. (Workarounds are typically sharing roles, taking turns
          etc. which we don’t support without hesitation.) Instead of making
          it fair, look at it from the organization’s perspective. It is not a
          <emphasis role="from-text">problem</emphasis> to have two good
          members who can fill a role and have the full support from their
          circle – it’s a gift. It’s the expectation that things be fair that
          makes it so hard, not the fact that there is a tie.</para>

          <para>Another aspect of this is that we do the organization – that
          is, ourselves – a disservice if we don’t make a decision or spend
          too much time on a decision that falls between <emphasis
          role="from-text">good enough</emphasis> and <emphasis
          role="from-text">safe enough</emphasis>. Sometimes doing <emphasis
          role="from-text">something</emphasis> is better.</para>

          <para>If it seems worth-while, we can have the two candidates talk
          to each other, ideally with the circle present. The potential catch

              <secondary>internalized power</secondary>

          doing it might still be uncomfortable. The first thought to keep in
          mind is that we are not objecting to a person. We are objecting to a

            </indexterm> or writing minutes just does not match the job
          description. In order to give useful feedback or to object, we will
          have to be specific. What could that person do differently so it
          <emphasis role="from-text">would</emphasis> work for us?</para>

          <para>Let us tell a personal story here. A friend of mine was
          nominated for facilitator. I was not happy. I did not want her to be
          facilitator. I was sitting with the judgment of <emphasis
          role="from-text">“whenever she facilitates, we never get anything
          done. Her style is too loose, and we’ll go round and round the
          circle without outcome”</emphasis>. I was judging, not seeing what
          my own needs are. That lack of clarity kept me from giving
          constructive feedback. If we are clear about what <emphasis
          role="from-text">we</emphasis> need, we can make a request<indexterm>
              <primary>request</primary>
            </indexterm> and give very clear input that is easy to hear. In
          this scenario, it could sound like this: <emphasis
          role="from-text">“You all know about me that I value effective
          meetings. I get impatient when things are not moving, and I realize
          I get more impatient more easily than most of you. I am concerned
          that it will be hard for me to sit through meetings. Can we make a
          deal? I am fine with XYZ facilitating if I can voice when things are
          moving too slowly for me and be sure I am heard and
          considered.”</emphasis> I did not object to XYZ, instead our circle
          just grew in mutual understanding. Of course, if I do not trust that
          the circle will support me, or if XYZ’s facilitation style really
          affects my work or the work of the circle, I will have to address it
          differently. The important pointer in this story is: own your own
          perceptions, feelings and needs first. There is a huge difference
          between these two statements: <emphasis role="from-text">“Your
          facilitation is muddy and ineffective”</emphasis> vs. <emphasis
          role="from-text">“I want facilitation to be clear and crisp so I
          don’t lose track of what we’re doing, and only that makes it
          possible for me to be productive in meetings. Therefore I am not
          confident that XYZ has the capacity to facilitate this
          circle.”</emphasis> Another way to look at it is that feedback may
          trigger another person’s hurt feeling but the feedback is not the
          cause. The cause of the pain is the receiver’s interpretation.
          Feedback, when delivered with care, is a gift.</para>

          <title>“What about me?”</title>

          <para>In the nomination<indexterm>
              <primary>nomination</primary>
            </indexterm> process, it is hard for some if they are not
          nominated. It might remind them of childhood experiences of being
          one of the last to be picked for a team. They experience selection
          process as a trial where the case is <emphasis role="from-text">“do
          my peers know/like me enough to nominate me?”</emphasis> A selection
          process is not a popularity contest and neither is it a process that
          needs to spread appreciation evenly. The circle is trying to fill a
          role, that’s all.</para>

          <para>We can take a deep breath and see what we do with the feedback
          that our skills are not visible to the group. We can nominate
          ourselves.</para>

          <para>(A new group may do a round on what history they bring to the
          selection process. In a safe group, we strongly encourage being
          vulnerable. It is possible to say something like <emphasis
          role="from-text">“this selection process was hard for me. I wanted
          my name to be among the nominations, and I wanted to be needed and
          considered. I understand that this is not about popularity but I do
          want to let you know that this was hard.”</emphasis> We could even
          ask for a quick round of people telling us what we bring to the
          circle or ask for suggestions about how we could improve your skills
          so that people would feel confident proposing us for that role in
          the future. That’s a matter of 5-10 minutes of meeting time. Why
          would it be worth spending those 5 minutes? Because it creates a
          sense of connection, trust and respect in the circle which is the
          basis for your collaboration. If we wanted to do a
          community-building exercise to build trust, we’d be very willing to
          spend the time on that – so why not go with a real moment? If all
          circle members learn over time that they can be vulnerable with each
          other, they can make an immense contribution to the
          organization.</para>

          </indexterm>

          <para>Another challenge comes up if the facilitator is attached to a
          particular outcome. In that case, the facilitator can acknowledge
          that bias and can ask someone else to facilitate that part of the
          meeting. Anyone who owns being biased will earn trust from any
          group. <emphasis role="from-text">“My dear friend/…is being
          nominated here, I don’t feel confident that I can do an unbiased job
          here. Roxanne, could you facilitate this
          election?”</emphasis></para>

          <para>The facilitator can also go through the process and then leave
          the proposal to someone else. <emphasis role="from-text">“Victor,
          would you be willing to make a selection proposal?”</emphasis> In
          the long run, this will have a healing and connecting effect on any
          group. Often, the tension disappears once it is acknowledged.</para>

          <para>If a facilitator repeatedly makes proposals that are
          uncomfortable for the circle, that feedback should be shared in the

          <title>Feelings will come up, no matter what</title>

          <para>We can easily forget that volunteering and majority vote come
          with emotional challenges as well. However, we are so used to
          considering voting “fair” that we do not acknowledge that. Just
          imagine what it feels like to get only one vote while there is a
          head to head race between two candidates who both got more than six
          votes.</para>

          <para>Sociocracy does not magically make everything comfortable and
          easy, and it cannot make emotional triggers disappear. What the
          sociocratic process <emphasis role="from-text">can</emphasis> do,
          however, is give space to talk about one’s feelings and
          interpretations. That requires a lot of maturity, and we are aware
          of that. To us, this is part of the package and preconditions of
          doing sociocracy successfully. Selection processes are another
          example where people are given “air time” to voice their feedback
          and opinions. Circle members still have to be brave enough to do it.
          The decision-making process does not do it for them in some magical
          way. However, what we notice is that groups can grow. Courage and
          vulnerability, alongside with kindness and honesty, are appreciated.
          In our training, we <emphasis role="from-text">always</emphasis>
          teach sociocracy with a compassionate communication (NVC)<indexterm>
              <primary>NVC (Non-Violent Communication)</primary>
            </indexterm> framework as a backdrop. If the emotional challenges
          around any governance decision are hard for your group, we strongly
          recommend educating your group on communication skills. See more on
          this topic in chapter <xref linkend="feedback"
          xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>.</para>

          <para>In general, we encourage groups to accept and acknowledge that
          feelings come up when we make decisions together. Better to be open
          about it than to pretend they are not there.</para>

        </indexterm>

        <para>The selection process can be used for more than just to fill
        roles. The selection process is useful whenever we have a discrete
        number of choices: for example, we can do a selection process where
        people nominate out of a set of vacation destinations; instead of
        people, we nominate places.</para>

        <para>It also works with numbers. We can do a selection process around
        the question <emphasis role="from-text">“should our membership fee be
        zero, $10, $20, or $50?”</emphasis> Then people would nominate an
        amount and share reasons why they nominated that amount. After hearing
        everyone, do a change round<indexterm>

          </indexterm>: <emphasis role="from-text">“Having heard what you
        heard, what amount would you nominate now?”</emphasis> The facilitator
        then makes a proposal and the circle is asked to consent or object.
        Our own community used the selection process to determine by how much
        the condominium fee would increase for a given year.</para>

        <para>With a more complex grid and interdependent choices, the process
        can be used to assign vegetables to rows in a garden, we can select a
        new hire or select which construction company will renovate our
        store.</para>

        <para>The first time a group uses the selection process for something
        that is not selecting people into roles, it may not feel as familiar
        but it is worth keeping selection processes in mind as another
        option.</para>

        is going on. On the other hand, if we imagine the same diagram showing
        the same situation for different individuals, it shows how the same
        situation can bring up different needs for different people. The point
        is that needs are at the same time universal – everyone has them – and

        But some are more effective than others, and that depends on the
        context. Going to the movies is an effective way of meeting the need

        choose to do something else to meet their need for connection. When we
        are not aware of our needs behind our strategies, it is very easy to
        get side-tracked into astonishingly ineffective strategies. Have you
        ever steamed out of a room, upset because what you really needed was
        connection? Leaving the room does not seem to be an effective strategy
        to get connection. Or when we yell at children because what we need is
        quiet? This is neither right or wrong in a moral sense, but it
        certainly is not effective.</para>

        this need. And that is true for every universal need, like

        people, we just differ in how important some needs are for us in the

        for us might not work for someone else. There is no 1:1 relation
        between needs and strategies. The same need can be met by different
        strategies. For example my need to be seen can be met by writing a
        post on social media, or by having a conversation with a neighbor. And

        what we <emphasis role="from-text">hear</emphasis>, not to what has
        been said or done. We see and hear everything through a layer of
        interpretation. But for this chapter, it is even more important to see
        the next step, what happens <emphasis
        role="from-text">after</emphasis> we receive (and interpret) a
        message. Consciously, or unconsciously, we evaluate. How does what

        <para>If our interpretation remains on the level of feelings or
        strategies, we cannot find out what is really going on. Going to the
        level of needs enables us to make more informed guesses about what
        might be an effective strategy. Sometimes people who hear about
        non-violent communication fear that they will “not be allowed to say
        what is really going on”. The opposite is true for us. Feelings and
        observable strategies are merely surface phenomena. Since needs are
        underlying everything we do and feel, talking about needs <emphasis
        role="from-text">is</emphasis> talking about what is really going on.
        Some people who start learning about needs and feelings consider this
        semantics. The fact that feelings are not directly caused by others,
        however, creates space for choice. Seeing the difference between
        strategies, needs and feelings creates space for inner freedom, and an
        opportunity for change.</para>

        <para>Requests are when we ask someone to do something. The more
        specific and doable a request is, the more likely it will be
        effective. The other person is <emphasis
        role="from-text">invited</emphasis> to say <emphasis
        role="from-text">yes</emphasis>. We naturally want to contribute and
        because we also want choice, we naturally resist demands.</para>

        <para>Non-violent communication (NVC) makes a distinction between
        action requests and connection requests that is very useful to
        organizational life. Action requests are simply that – <emphasis
        role="from-text">“would you make copies of this form? Would you call
        that potential donor or customer?”</emphasis> Sometimes action
        requests are requests for collaboration: <emphasis
        role="from-text">“Would you help me brainstorm ideas for a new webinar
        series on sociocracy? Would you be willing to sit with me and talk
        about how we could improve our relationship?”</emphasis></para>

        <para>The only reason anyone would ever say no to a request to
        contribute to our needs is that they are saying yes to meeting their
        own needs. The <emphasis role="from-text">no</emphasis> becomes the
        invitation to connection – a mutual understanding of each other’s
        needs. Therefore, there are two kinds of connection requests. To be
        understood: <emphasis role="from-text">“Would you be willing to tell
        me whatever you heard me say?”</emphasis> To understand: <emphasis
        role="from-text">“Would you be willing to tell me what comes up for
        you when you hear what I said?”</emphasis> Imagine what we could
        accomplish if (a) we could eliminate misunderstandings and (b) hear
        each other more empathically!</para>

        needs are their own, and the responsibility to meet them is no one’s
        but theirs. They have a need for connection, and there are many
        strategies to meet that need. One of the strategies would be to call a
        friend and talk. Another strategy would be for them to look at old
        pictures. Or to spend time on social media, go out to dance or call
        their sister. Only they can pick and choose what might work for them
        in that moment.</para>

        <para>Let’s say a coworker calls. I do not like talking on the phone.
        Talking on the phone for me simply does not work as a strategy in most
        cases. Maybe it is because my hearing is not good, so listening
        without visual cues is straining. I am also concerned that talking in
        my shared office space will interfere with my colleague’s focus. I
        also don’t like being interrupted because I enjoy the flow state of
        focused work. What works well for me is messaging. So I do not answer
        the phone but I message back. My coworker, however, prefers talking on
        the phone. For her, not a fast typer, it is more effective to talk on
        the phone than to message back and forth. She might get annoyed when I
        don’t answer the phone but message back. Did I <emphasis
        role="from-text">make</emphasis> her upset? No. Her being upset is her
        reaction to her own needs for connection<indexterm>

          </indexterm>. Now what?</para>

        <para>If we have no awareness of needs, both sides might be rolling
        their eyes and have thoughts like <emphasis role="from-text">“why
        doesn’t he just answer the phone instead of making it so complicated
        by messaging back and forth?”</emphasis> and <emphasis
        role="from-text">“why is she interrupting me by calling all the time.
        Does she think she is the only person working here?”</emphasis> What
        can we do to meet our needs more effectively? We can give feedback
        based on our needs. The first step is to share our experience.</para>

        <figure xml:id="textcall">

        </figure>

        <para>In example <xref linkend="textcall"
        xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>, notice how both people are able to
        share their experience without labeling the other person or even
        talking about the other person. Once that first step of mutual
        understanding is complete, the path is open to a shared decision. With
        everyone’s needs on the table, a strategy may be found that works for
        everyone. Maybe arrange a time to talk on the phone? Leaving the
        office to talk on the phone while the co-worker needs space? If the
        issue comes up more often, maybe re-thinking the shared office
        space?</para>

        <para>We are rarely short on strategies once we have clarity about
        needs. The more information we have, the more we are in choice about
        what strategy works best in that moment.</para>

        <para>Feedback that can be heard is feedback that is free of blame.
        Any added layer of blame will cover up the data we want to be known.
        Making sure that the other person is in a good enough place to receive

        saying the words will not be enough. Only when it is truly felt, will
        it be genuine and effective. People have a very fine radar and can

        <para>If we feel like we are in a good enough place to receive

        <para>A feedback form can provide a frame for giving feedback in

        <title>Personal aims and the organization’s aim</title>

        <para>It is interesting to think about how the organization’s need and
        people’s needs relate to each other. In joining an organization, we
        respond to a need of ours. Getting paid for our work may help meet our
        survival needs. But there are other needs at play. It could be wanting
        to contribute, or the need for connection<indexterm>
            <primary>connection (need)</primary>
          </indexterm><indexterm>
            <primary>needs; examples</primary>

            <secondary>connection</secondary>
          </indexterm>. The ‘‘need’’ of the organization is to contribute to
        the organization’s mission. Every strategy<indexterm>
            <primary>strategy</primary>
          </indexterm> -- every operation and every policy<indexterm>
            <primary>policy</primary>
          </indexterm> – serves the organization’s aims. We often ask people
        about their personal aims in an organization to explore the
        relationship between their personal aims and the organization’s aims.
        The more they are in alignment, the easier it will be for the
        individuals to work at fulfilling the organization’s aim.</para>

        <para>Organizations are complex organisms. Many sub-aims<indexterm>
            <primary>aim</primary>

            <secondary>sub-aim</secondary>
          </indexterm> are at play. For example, two circles might be wanting
        their budget<indexterm>
            <primary>budget</primary>
          </indexterm> increased. Although they serve the same overall aim,
        they disagree on strategy-level. This is similar to a person who might
        be at the same time experiencing a need for connection<indexterm>
            <primary>connection (need)</primary>
          </indexterm><indexterm>
            <primary>needs; examples</primary>

            <secondary>connection</secondary>
          </indexterm> and a need for peace and quiet<indexterm>
            <primary>peace and quiet (need)</primary>

            <primary>needs; examples</primary>

            <secondary>peace and quiet</secondary>
          </indexterm>. As such, an organization can be just as innerly torn
        as a person. All needs can be taken seriously, but not all needs can
        be met. Personal aims and organizational aims sometimes are in synch
        and sometimes not. We celebrate needs met and mourn needs unmet. With
        transparency about both personal and organizational aims, we have the
        potential to work effectively toward meeting both personal needs and
        organizational needs.</para>

            <secondary>belonging</secondary>
          </indexterm> would not be met. Once we identify the need(s) that are
        unmet, we will be able to object and put the unmet needs on the table
        so they can be considered.</para>

        <para>What is the difference between example <xref
        linkend="textmembership" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> and <xref
        linkend="textmembership2" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>? In the
        first example, there is no inner distance from the feelings. They are
        interpreted as absolute truth, not as data to work with. The
        opportunity to use the feelings as an indicator of a need gets
        concealed, and we have to restore trust and respect in the group.
        Since restoring trust and respect takes time, we have lost time and
        energy in two ways: by losing track of valuable data, and by creating
        ‘‘social-emotional debt’’ that is likely to negatively impact the
        quality of connection in the future.<indexterm>
            <primary>social-emotional debt</primary>
          </indexterm></para>

        <para>We call social-emotional debt the many micro and macro
        interactions where people experience their needs not considered.
        Whether or not that is true is not relevant. Unaddressed, this debt
        builds up over time and creates more and more interpersonal
        friction.</para>

        <para>Everyone is responsible for the social-emotional debt – the
        people who chose not to speak up or did not speak up effectively,
        <emphasis role="from-text">and</emphasis> the people who chose a
        strategy without considering more people’s needs and did not ask for
        feedback.</para>

        <para>It is a reality of humanity that feelings come up. If we ignore
        them, they will leak. People will be sarcastic, discouraged,
        disengaged. They will withdraw, lack accountability, work to rule,
        slow down, or undermine the system. Ignoring needs, ignoring feedback
        has a high long-term cost.</para>

        <para>We may not get input from circle members that is as clear as in
        example <xref linkend="textmembership2"
        xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>. But we can work together to
        complete the picture. A skillful group will be able to deal with
        <emphasis role="from-text">“something here leaves me anxious but I
        can’t put my finger on it”</emphasis> and will guess the underlying
        needs. A more advanced group will be able to deal with the raw
        feeling, will help the group member to center, identify their needs
        and formulate their concern. The question is not whether feelings are
        allowed in organizations but how we make use of them.<itemizedlist>

        <title>Short feedback loops</title>

        <para>We need to check on our data frequently enough to be able to

          </indexterm> For our operations, the same is true to be effective.
        Once feedback is nothing but data, all ways of gathering and receiving
        data and personal feedback are the same. We have already talked about

        measure<indexterm>
            <primary>lead - do - measure</primary>
          </indexterm></emphasis> and how it forms feedback loops that support
        the evolution: we make a plan, we carry it out, and we evaluate what
        we can learn. Steering falls into countless loops of <emphasis
        role="from-text">lead – do – measure</emphasis>. A few examples are in

        <emphasis role="from-text">lead – do – measure</emphasis> happens on

        creates habits around giving feedback, which we fledge out as
        milestones in this book – intentional stops to make sure we have
        shared reality. We showed how in policy-making, a group can move
        swiftly from one phase to the next if we measure whether a phase or
        step is completed.</para>

        <title>Hearing from as many as possible – while keeping groups
        small</title>

        <para>In sociocracy, we want to learn as much as we can and work with
        all the data we can access to feed into our decision making. We also
        try to keep the groups who make decisions to a reasonable group size
        so that all member voices can be heard. A critical aspect of
        sociocracy is clarity about membership<indexterm>
            <primary>circle</primary>

            <secondary>circle membership</secondary>
          </indexterm><indexterm>

            <secondary>membership in a circle</secondary>

        authority<indexterm>
            <primary>authority</primary>

            <secondary>authority over membership</secondary>
          </indexterm> over who its members are. Decisions are made through
        deliberation among people who have made a commitment to work together
        toward a shared aim. It is crucial to understand the difference
        between “hearing everyone’s feedback” and “including everyone in the
        decision making”. Sociocracy clearly says <emphasis
        role="from-text">yes</emphasis> to getting as much feedback as your
        circle can handle, while keeping decision making within the circle
        that is responsible for the particular content.</para>

        <para>What’s the difference between being able to give feedback and
        being a decision-maker? If a membership circle makes a decision to
        significantly raise membership fees, they might want to hear from
        people outside the circle about that. They might even want to survey
        their entire membership. However, that only means that this circle now
        has more information. They are not bound to anything but to inviting
        and taking in the feedback they get.</para>

        <para>In an organization that is new to sociocracy, be very clear on
        the difference between “being heard” and “being involved in the
        decision making”. Sometimes when we ask people for their input, they
        take it personally if you decide different from their advice, even if
        you have honestly considered their input. That’s where transparency
        comes in: <emphasis role="from-text">why</emphasis> did we decide the
        way we decided? It helps to let people know the rationale for our
        decisions if we think it is relevant and that it could be contributing
        to people’s understanding. The strength of sociocracy comes with the
        ability to make decisions effectively in small groups while including
        a lot of data through gathering feedback.</para>

        <para>The path from issue to action does not have to be walked alone

        each step, depending on what’s needed. The process is extremely
        flexible because at any stage (except the consent decision), any

                <para>In the input phase, we want the input from many

                issues with our new website”</emphasis>, we will get a lot of

                on few, specific questions, for example, how long users stay
                on the new website compared to the old one. If we only ask
                three test users, we can process much more detailed data but

                each other’s thoughts, we have to be in relationship with each

          <para>Every policy decision in sociocracy has a term end when the

          <para>We can be intentional about term ends and tailor them to our
          needs. For example, we could make new policy and consent to
          reviewing it again in 3 months. Or in 10 years. What an appropriate
          term might be for a piece of policy depends on the nature of the
          organization. In general, we try to make the cycles long enough to

          <para>We want to be sure to keep our policies current. If we only
          review our policies every 10 years (or never!), we will most likely
          not keep them current. How many organizations have policies that
          they are not even aware of? We don’t have policies to have them.
          Policy is made to support us in doing our work. Therefore, every
          policy has to reflect the current state of how things are being
          done, otherwise the organization becomes stiff and ineffective.
          Putting a term end on policy is just a reminder to review policies.
          If no one sees need for changing a policy, then reviewing a policy
          can be done in minutes.</para>

          time. If there is a reason to change policy, there is no reason to

      with informing, inviting and scheduling the members of the performance
      review circle (aka assessment circle). They develop an action plan of
      how the focus person can improve. It ends with a decision by the focus

        <para>The first step is to have the right people in the room. The aim
        of a performance review is to give feedback to the focus person in
        their role(s) in the organization. We can do a performance review in
        our circle if we are only part of one circle. The performance review
        can also be done by a group of members who do not usually form a
        circle. For people in linking<indexterm>
            <primary>linking</primary>
          </indexterm> roles (leader or delegate), we need the perspective of
        all circle layers we are a part of. If there is substantial
        interaction to another circle (for example in a hand-off<indexterm>
            <primary>hand-off</primary>
          </indexterm> to a more specific ‘‘sub’’-circle), then one or two
        members from that circle can be invited to the performance review. The
        idea is that every level relating to the focus person<indexterm>
            <primary>performance review</primary>

            <secondary>focus person</secondary>
          </indexterm> is represented. Not everyone in a related circle needs
        to be invited, keeping the group to a workable group size.</para>

        <para>The feedback circle will come up with an improvement plan. The

            the proposal is being written up, the process continues: the
            proposal requires the feedback circle’s consent. Possibly, it can
            also also require the consent of all of the circles in which the
            focus person is a member. (It depends on the focus of the
            performance review. Find a reasonable balance between a focus that
            is too wide and a focus that is too narrow. The decision of who is
            going to have consent rights on the proposal should be made before
            the performance review begins.)</para>

          <para>The proposal needs to be stated clearly and distributed to
          everyone with consent rights. Then it needs to be approved, by
          consent by (at least) the performance review circle – including the
          focus person – and/or all the circle with whom the focus person
          works. The improvement plan will be kept in the records in written
          form (public to the organization) like a policy but not in the
          policy agreements since it only affects one person.</para>

          <para>Once the term gets close, the focus person will start planning
          another performance review and the cycle begins again. The next
          performance review acts as a measure for whether the improvement
          plan has been put into practice, and at the same time as the
          beginning of a new cycle.</para>

        <title>There is no right way of doing sociocracy</title>

        <para>There is no right or wrong in governance. Groups that are new to
        sociocracy, from time to time, play the governance police. Sociocracy
        is <emphasis role="from-text">never</emphasis> rigid. Balance is built
        into sociocracy, and only a dynamic balance will be resilient. If we
        catch ourselves being in a “right fight” on how to do sociocracy, we
        are already on the track toward <emphasis role="from-text">right and
        wrong</emphasis>. There is no “right way” of doing sociocracy,
        especially if the discussion around what is right is creating
        disconnect. What we have been describing here in this book is not “the
        right way” but rather what we as the authors have found to be
        effective.</para>

        <para>Effectiveness is the measure of governance<indexterm>
            <primary>effectiveness</primary>
          </indexterm>. Sociocracy is more than how to do a round or how to

        it is a <emphasis role="from-text">mindset</emphasis> that there is a

      <section>
        <title>And there is no wrong way of doing sociocracy</title>

        <para>The good news is that there is also no wrong way. We might mess
        up from time to time. For example, we have facilitated meetings where
        we assumed that an objection was addressed well in an amended proposal
        and rushed toward the consent round<indexterm>
            <primary>consent round</primary>
          </indexterm>. When there is upset in the room and all of a sudden
        everyone wants to speak, that is feedback<indexterm>
            <primary>feedback</primary>
          </indexterm> that we had pushed too hard and continued too fast. We
        have regretted from time to time erring on the side of effectiveness
        instead of going for equivalence by slowing down. On the other hand,
        we have called explorative rounds where everyone passed because there
        was nothing relevant to say – could we have known that the group was
        ready for the next step already? Did we just waste minutes on a round
        that turned out to be unnecessary? That happens. The good thing is: if
        we have a good system in place, we will still come to a product that
        is good enough. There is no reason to be afraid to do something wrong.
        Instead, we pay attention to feedback, because chances are we do
        things that aren’t perfect – the practice is to notice, adjust, and
        learn.</para>

        <para>The context in which circle members find themselves might affect
        how present and generous they are with their time and energy, and how
        willing they are to take risks. As we get to know each other more, we

        caring.</para>

        <para>Themed check-ins (having people check-in responding to a quote
        or a question/topic) can be done but <emphasis
        role="from-text">always</emphasis> leave some space for people to
        share what might be going on for them. For example, someone in the
        group could be care-taker of an elderly mother, and possibly alarmed
        by a health scare – confining them to a well-intended prompt might
        fail to include them where they are in that moment. Someone could be
        anxious about an agenda item, or upset about something they
        experienced last meeting. There could be a personal tension between
        circle members. Someone could be dealing with relationship issues. All
        these circumstances, and countless more, are meaningful to share
        <emphasis role="from-text">if we choose to</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>If the interpersonal tension or anxiety is circle-related, we
        might choose to put it on the agenda or on the backlog. Or we might
        invite a member to share more after the meeting. If someone seems
        distressed, appoint a person to check with the member after the
        meeting. We have been to meetings where we lovingly sent someone home
        after the check-in (with their consent, of course) because given where
        they were emotionally, that seemed like the only appropriate thing to
        do to hold them with care.</para>

        <para>Remember, all human collaboration starts from connection, and
        connection can only happen when we are authentic and show up as who we

      possible.</para>

      <para>The content part of the meeting also falls into 3 phases. First we
      plan and consent to the agenda – deciding which items from the backlog
      we intend to talk about. Then we go through each agenda item. The third
      phase is when we assess briefly what agenda items we have completed,
      what to-do items remain and what carries over into the next meeting,
      which we summarize as “updating the backlog”.</para>

        <para>The decision of what we are going to talk about in a meeting is
        significant. The agenda proposal may have been prepared by someone in
        the circle, for example the facilitator (see section <xref

        might be created in the moment.</para>

        what does not. Is the circle going to address a challenging topic, or
        is it going to table that topic again and again? If meeting time is
        limited, which agenda items have priority over others? How much time
        is the circle going to give each agenda item? We make those decisions
        by consent, and in doing so, ownership of the agenda is transferred
        from the person who prepared the agenda to the circle. Even throughout
        the meeting, <emphasis role="from-text">any significant change in the

        <para>A side-note on co-created agendas: Some circles meet and make
        their agenda together, at the beginning of the meeting and without use
        of a backlog. While this works well enough in some groups, all groups
        would benefit from a thought-through agenda proposal. It is too easy
        for agenda items to fall through the cracks and to lack intention and
        forward motion. In a situation where we start without a prepared
        agenda proposal, we can make an agenda “on the fly”. Steps in
        co-creating an agenda:<itemizedlist>

        <title>Content block: 3 desired outcomes</title>

        <indexterm>
          <primary>desired outcome</primary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>For every agenda item, there are exactly three possible outcomes
        as shown in figure <xref linkend="buildingblocks"
        xrefstyle="select: labelnumber page"/>: <emphasis
        role="from-text">understanding a report, exploring an issue</emphasis>
        or <emphasis role="from-text">making a decision</emphasis>. That means
        that any agenda item will be one of those three, and it’s best if a
        group is able to name which one it is before talking about the agenda
        item.</para>

        <para>As one can see in diagram <xref linkend="buildingblocks"
        xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>, the desired outcomes build on each
        other. Every agenda item starts with <emphasis
        role="from-text">understanding</emphasis>, and for a report that is
        all we do. If the desired outcome is to ask for feedback, the
        <emphasis role="from-text">understanding</emphasis> phase is followed
        by a phase of exploration. If we are aiming to make a decision, we go
        through <emphasis role="from-text">understand</emphasis> and <emphasis
        role="from-text">explore</emphasis> and then toward a decision.</para>

        <para>Here are examples of how it is helpful to know your desired
        outcome:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If an agenda<indexterm>
                  <primary>agenda</primary>
                </indexterm> item is to <emphasis
              role="from-text">report<indexterm>
                  <primary>desired outcome</primary>

                  <secondary>report</secondary>
                </indexterm></emphasis> to the group of a decision that has
              been made elsewhere, then there is no need to go into a
              discussion. If circle members are aware of that, this agenda
              item is not going to get out of hand.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>If the desired outcome is to hear feedback and
              explore<indexterm>
                  <primary>desired outcome</primary>

                  <secondary>exploration</secondary>
                </indexterm>, we will have clarity on the scope of this agenda
              item – no one will expect a decision and we will not waste time
              trying to come to convergence if that is not what has been asked
              of us.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>The desired outcome might change while we are talking
        about it. For example, we might notice that we cannot come to a
        decision during the meeting. In this case, we have to either formally
        drop this desired outcome (which requires consent since everyone
        consented to the agenda) or we have to make a plan on when/how the
        decision can be made. For example, do a round of feedback and then
        delegate to a helping circle<indexterm>
            <primary>helping circle</primary>
          </indexterm> for more research and a recommendation in the next
        meeting.</para>

        <para>Being aware of what kind of agenda item we are dealing with also
        gives a clearer understanding of what kinds of <emphasis
        role="from-text">tools</emphasis> might be useful to get to that
        desired outcome<indexterm>
            <primary>desired outcome</primary>
          </indexterm>. The most important ones are mentioned in figure <xref
        linkend="buildingblocks" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>. These
        steps align with the different kinds of rounds we use but there is no
        1:1 match – there are different ways to hold these agenda
        items.</para>

        <para>Extra clarity can be gained if, for every agenda item, we end by
        measuring whether we have achieved the desired outcome. Facilitators
        can make it a habit to pause before moving to a new agenda item by
        assessing whether the desired outcome has been achieved and by asking
        the secretary to read out loud what has been written in the
        notes.</para>

          <para>During reports, the circle is being informed. A report is
          complete when all clarifying questions have been answered. A report
          does not require exploration. The reporting member might be a circle
          member, a written piece of input or a report from an attending
          visitor. Examples are:<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Reports from operational steps. For example, a circle
                member was asked to talk with someone outside of the circle to
                hold that member accountable to policy. After doing so, the

                delegate of the Membership Circle reports that they decided to

                already have been a lot of feedback given in the process and
                there is no need for feedback, or feedback can happen outside
                of the meeting.</para>

          <para>If we are asking for shared exploration, we start by giving
          input (a report, an idea, a request) and making sure that this input
          is understood. Therefore, the first block in asking for feedback is
          reporting and answering questions. The second step is inviting
          feedback. This can take as long as is considered necessary and
          productive. Examples:<itemizedlist>

        <title>The flow of agenda items</title>

        <para>In some frameworks, operational meetings are strictly distinct
        from policy meetings. Here, we are assuming they both can happen
        within the same meeting because the circle decides what to decide in
        operational, case-by-case decisions and what to make policy on. There
        can be agreements on doing operational-only meetings, but most policy
        meetings will contain some talking about operations. (See more on
        operational meetings in section <xref linkend="operationalmeetings"
        xrefstyle="select: labelnumber page"/>.)</para>

        <para>That said, the first agenda item of a meeting might be
        finalizing policy around topic A and assigning tasks. The second
        agenda item might be exploring a topic. The third agenda item might be
        a report from a new issue. The fourth agenda item might be to assign
        circle members tasks around an upcoming event, and the fifth might be
        a review of a policy.</para>

        <para>An operational agenda item can be very brief (see Example <xref
        linkend="exampleoperationalagendaitem"
        xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>).</para>

        <figure xml:id="exampleoperationalagendaitem">
          <title>Example of an operational agenda item within a circle
          meeting</title>

          <mediaobject>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>If a discussion about an operational tasks triggers the need for
        more talking and maybe policy (you can tell by the fact that there is
        a discussion flaring up, see Ex. <xref
        linkend="examplepolicyflaringup" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>),
        remain intentional in your process. Many decisions can be made as a
        one-time decision. If it seems worthwhile to make a guideline for
        operations (i.e. policy), decide together (by consent) whether to
        modify your meeting agenda to fit in a policy decision or whether to
        put the policy decision on the backlog.</para>

        <para>For example, the circle could create a role for a publicity
        manager that would take all the kinds of action steps discussed.
        Thereafter, the person filling that role would take off those
        activities and this topic would not show up on future agendas. New
        items sometimes arise in the middle of meetings. It is important then
        not to let the new item take over the agenda without consideration.
        The facilitator can guide the circle whether or not to change the
        agenda that was consented to at the beginning of the meeting. If there
        is no consent to change the agenda, the new item is added to the
        backlog. The circle may also identify and assign any next steps needed
        to prepare that item for future discussion.</para>

        <para>Remember that a typical policy decision-making process (as
        described in section <xref linkend="decision-making-steps"
        xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>) goes through different phases: (1)
        understanding the issue, (2) generating a proposal, (3) making a
        decision. How a group spreads out those phases into meetings is
        entirely up to the circle. One can go through all the decision-making
        steps in one meeting, or spread them out over several meetings. Then
        we see what happens as we implement the policy. Once we review it we
        make changes if needed, following the same consent process (see figure
        <xref linkend="reviewpolicy1"

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>Meeting evaluations are an opportunity to learn from

      interpersonal dynamics.</para>

      <para>The diagram in <xref linkend="meetingevaluation"
      xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> illustrates what people can touch on
      during the evaluation round. The intention is not to cover <emphasis
      role="from-text">all</emphasis> those areas but to show the variety of
      topics to evaluate.</para>

      <para>If we want to address something interpersonal, remember that
      effective feedback<indexterm>
          <primary>feedback</primary>
        </indexterm> is feedback that is easy to receive, specific, and
      blame-free. Of course, a meeting evaluation is not a magic fix. A
      governance method cannot fix what people have to do: speak up and take
      action. If there is a circle member that behaves in a way that makes it
      hard for us to participate, we share the responsibility to speak up.
      There are many ways to address behavior, but the meeting evaluation can
      be the first and easiest one. More examples of things to say during
      meeting evaluations can be found in section <xref
      linkend="feedback-on-meetings"
      xrefstyle="select: labelnumber page"/>.</para>

      <para>If something needs attention, the circle will set some time aside
      in a <emphasis role="from-text">future</emphasis> meeting to address it;
      for example if the circle meetings go significantly over time on a
      regular basis, we need to make time at a future meeting to talk about
      it. In that case, put the evaluation (<emphasis
      role="from-text">“observation: meetings go over time a lot”</emphasis>)
      in your <indexterm>
          <primary>backlog</primary>

        </indexterm> and leader<indexterm>
          <primary>leader</primary>
        </indexterm> can decide whether and how to address it before or in a
      future meeting. Other strategies for improvement might also go into the
      meeting’s notes for later consideration. This could be the need for more
      training on process, a mediation, or a policy around circle admin
      matters. Overall, inhabit a mindset of growth: how can these meetings be
      better next time? Or, even better, what will make our circle meetings
      awesome? Remember to be specific. Meetings would work better for you if
      they started on time? Say that! Groups sometimes seem to accept that
      meetings would be lengthy or irritating. Sociocratic meetings, if
      well-run, are refreshing, connecting and energizing. That is the
      benchmark we are aiming for.</para>

        important to keep in mind is that regardless of who prepares the
        agenda proposal, what we choose to <emphasis
        role="from-text">accept</emphasis> as the agenda is a consent decision
        by all circle members. The circle members hold equal responsibility
        for the agenda once consented to.</para>

        <para>Logistics: There is variety in how sociocratic organizations set
        the agenda for their circle meetings. One practice is to have the
        leader<indexterm>
            <primary>leader</primary>
          </indexterm>, facilitator<indexterm>
            <primary>facilitator</primary>
          </indexterm> and secretary<indexterm>
            <primary>secretary</primary>
          </indexterm> prepare the agenda proposal. The initiative comes from
        the facilitator who will contact the leader and secretary.

            <primary>agenda</primary>
          </indexterm> is made by secretary, facilitator and leader, bringing

              meeting’s agenda does not provide the long-term planning. For

                  <primary>secretary</primary>

                  <primary>logbook keeper</primary>
                </indexterm> needs to remember to put this on the agenda. We
              might also decide to go for an error-proof option and put all

                  <primary>backlog</primary>
                </indexterm> and keep them there (see figure <xref

              circles select all their roles on the same day each year. Some
              organizations ask all their circles to review the policies in
              their domain at the same time, for example from September to
              October of odd number years. These are easy ways to support

            <title>Timing</title>

            <para>It is essential to put time information into an agenda, at
            least more or less. The reason to do this is to have <emphasis
            role="from-text">feedback<indexterm>
                <primary>feedback</primary>
              </indexterm></emphasis> during the meeting. Timing information
            does not have to be followed by the book. If we notice in the
            middle of agenda item 1 that we are already 25 minutes behind our
            own schedule, we will know that we need to make adjustments. We
            cannot always predict in advance how long an item will take but we
            can make a good guess. During the meeting, we compare the plan to
            reality and consider the implications. What changes do we want to
            make to the rest of the agenda for this meeting?</para>

            <para>Be realistic! If a group does over time chronically, it
            might work to address it and be intentional about how meetings are
            planned and run. Maybe we need to increase the meeting time,
            frequency, outsource reporting out of meeting time, or make more
            use of helping circles<indexterm>
                <primary>helping circle</primary>
              </indexterm>. There are many ways to address timing but the
            first step is to have a way of assessing how we intend to use our
            time.</para>

            </indexterm>

            <para>For a more general look at content during meeting agendas it
            helps to think back to the three possible content items or desired
            outcomes as described earlier in section <xref
            linkend="contentblock" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber page"/>:
            reports/understanding, exploration and making decisions (synthesis
            or output). Each agenda item needs to be assigned one of these
            desired outcomes. The desired outcomes are measurements for each
            agenda item.</para>

            <para>Don’t aim too high. Sometimes just getting to a shared
            understanding of the status quo is a success! Whatever we do, this
            is our starting point, as all three desired outcomes have
            <emphasis role="from-text">shared understanding</emphasis> as a
            first step. Confirm that people are on the same page and have a
            shared understanding of what there is to know (to the level of
            detail that makes sense in your context).</para>

            <para>Be proactive and intentional, instead of just dealing with

        generate together, as shown in example <xref linkend="diagramminutes"

        <para>Additionally, the notes of a particular <emphasis

        <para>If we consent to a policy in a meeting, the new policy needs to
        be added to the appropriate document (policy manual, organizational
        agreements, rules and regulations) of the organization’s

            <primary>logbook</primary>
          </indexterm>. Policies are only useful if people know about them.
        Make sure to implement a logbook system that works for the
        organization. In sociocracy, in large organizations, there is the
        additional role of a logbook keeper <indexterm>
            <primary>logbook keeper</primary>
          </indexterm> (see section <xref linkend="logbookkeeper"

            <primary>logbook</primary>
          </indexterm>logbook remains up to date and accessible to everyone in
        the organization (or even to the public). Note: It is useful to do
        ongoing education about existing policies to your organization.</para>

        <para>Meeting minutes are a natural place to invite feedback<indexterm>
            <primary>feedback</primary>
          </indexterm>. However, keep in mind that not everyone will read
        every set of meeting minutes that are published. If we want feedback
        on something, it helps to be explicit and make a clear
        request<indexterm>

        to put out our minutes depends on the nature and the patterns we find
        in our organization and in our culture. Sociocracy balances out the
        relationship between individuals and circles. Circles have to make an
        effort to be transparent, while individuals have to make an effort to
        respond to the information. There is no right and wrong here –

        </indexterm>

        <para>Although sociocracy did not invent rounds, they are the
        signature tool. Like all tools in sociocracy, rounds support equal
        voice and effectiveness. Everyone gets a chance to talk. Everyone
        listens. Rounds are often the first tool from sociocracy that a group
        starts using.</para>

        <para>Rounds are simple: the facilitator<indexterm>
            <primary>facilitator</primary>
          </indexterm> gives the prompt, and calls on one person to speak.
        After that person has spoken, the person next to the first speaker has
        a turn, until everyone has spoken. Depending on the nature of the
        topic and the group size, one round might take 20 seconds or 20
        minutes or anything in between.</para>

        <para>We know that for some people rounds take some time to get used
        to. If people argue that rounds are “constraining”, “artificial” and
        or they prefer “natural” flow, consider: <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>What is “natural” is highly debatable. For example, there
              are/were times and cultures where it was unthinkable for a child
              to speak during family dinner without being asked. People then
              probably assumed their style of family dinner was the “natural”
              order of things.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Rounds have been practiced in some cultures for hundreds
              if not thousands of years. Rounds become second nature fairly
              quickly.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>It is very likely that internalized power patterns shape
              how we show up in a meeting with “natural” flow. This means the
              cultural biases we might not even be aware of might give one
              group of people more time to talk than other groups. This may be
              based on class, race, gender or other categories. The same
              biases even distort our perception of how long and how often
              people from different groups speak. Our perception of what is
              “equal” might not be accurate.</para>

          <para>Not having any format in a meeting typically turns discussions
          into debates. In debate style conversations, whoever speaks up will
          be heard, and heard again if they repeat themselves. This works well
          for people who have an easy time with this kind of format. It does
          not work for people who don’t enjoy having to overtalk people to
          contribute. Some people are more likely to engage in over-talking
          than others. We favor more extroverted or privileged people if we
          choose to talk in debate style. Since debate style is what we resort
          to in the absence of a format, <emphasis
          role="from-text">not</emphasis> being intentional about how we talk
          with each other will favor <emphasis
          role="from-text">some</emphasis> voices and ignore others. It is
          crucial to understand that <emphasis role="from-text">not making the
          choice to talk in rounds is still a choice we make with its own
          implications</emphasis>.</para>

          <para>When we talk in rounds, we know that we will have our turn to
          talk. We don’t have to sit in a discussion wondering how to get our
          contribution heard, and how to get a turn. We can relax and know
          that the group will get a chance to hear our input.</para>

        <section>
          <title>How rounds support everyone to listen</title>

          <para>In debate style, everybody loses. Just because someone is less
          likely to speak up in a heated discussion, does not mean their
          contribution is less valuable. This means that if we choose to skip
          rounds, we lose out on valuable information.</para>

          <para>Rounds change the dynamics of a conversation. When it is other
          people’s turn, we can sit back and listen. And by that we mean:
          really listen. I don’t have to wait for a good moment to jump in and
          interrupt. I don’t have to think about how to prove the other person
          wrong. I can just listen and take in the other circle members’
          experience.</para>

          <para>In debate style, we often tend to try and convince people of
          our viewpoint. When some express different views, others may repeat
          their own views again, just louder. With rounds, it feels more like
          everyone brings their ideas, perspectives and experiences to the
          table. It is more like an offering to the group because it is not
          targeted at anyone.</para>

          <para>We can only be a group when we are sure that everyone in the
          circle is included. Talking in rounds gives everyone the confidence
          that their voice matters. What we each bring individually becomes
          the group’s. The group wisdom starts growing in the middle of the
          circle. It is deeply satisfying when that happens, and rounds make
          it much more likely.</para>

          <para>In debate style, our “task” is to win. In rounds, we spend
          more time listening than speaking. We each have access to only our
          view of the world. After taking in the experience of a number of
          people in a row without even considering saying something for
          myself, it becomes obvious how my own experience is just <emphasis
          role="from-text">one</emphasis> way to see things. One way among
          many others.</para>

          <title>How rounds save time</title>

          <para>When people start out learning about rounds, their first
          judgment is often that rounds will be lengthy and not time
          efficient. It takes a bit of practice and experience to see how the
          opposite is true. There are several ways in which rounds support
          effectiveness<indexterm>
              <primary>effectiveness</primary>

              <secondary>rounds and effectiveness</secondary>
            </indexterm>. <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>In debate style, people feel compelled to re-state their
                contribution so they can be sure they can be heard. Rounds
                slow down conversations enough so every contribution can be
                taken in and valued. Statements typically do not need to be
                repeated. We all have been in discussions where the same thing
                was said by the same person multiple times. Rounds reduce the
                amount of redundancy because we can be sure we hear it the
                first time.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>In rounds, as much information as possible is heard
                early in the process. That means we as a group (or, more
                precisely, a subset of the group) don’t run into one direction
                just to find out it was a dead end. We move more slowly,
                taking into account a wider number of aspects and viewpoints.
                That way, we don’t have to change direction as many times.
                Slow and steady!</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>There is a subtle but powerful effect of rounds: rounds
                help us stay on track. When we start a round, we all start
                with the same prompt. That means, everyone having their turn
                after the first person to speak has options: refer back to the
                prompt and increase the variety of opinions in the group and
                to see an issue from different angles. The other option is to
                reflect on what other people have already said and let
                statements build on each other with increasing information in
                the group. Ideally, people do both, share their initial
                reaction and their reflections on what has been stated before
                them. In an ideal world, people are transparent about that and
                build their statements according to the pattern <emphasis
                role="from-text">“My first reaction/idea was…, and then I
                heard Eduardo speak, and I learned that…, and now I think
                that…”</emphasis> Rounds give us the maximum input, both from
                individuals and for building group wisdom.</para>

              <listitem>
                <para>When everyone is part of a decision, it increases the

                contribute to a decision, no one will undermine carrying out

            <primary>clarifying questions round</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>A clarifying questions round is called whenever there has been
          a proposal, a statement or idea that needs to be understood
          <emphasis role="from-text">before</emphasis> the circle members form
          or state their opinions. This could be a policy proposal, or a
          report, but it could also be a complex objection. We are transparent
          about the nature of the round: <emphasis role="from-text">“Let’s
          make sure we understand the proposal/objection before we talk about
          it more. Now is the time to ask the questions you need to have
          answered before moving forward.”</emphasis></para>

          <para>Questions can either be gathered in a round and then answered
          by a knowledgeable person in the room, or they can be answered one
          by one as they come up. When answers are simple and short, answer
          them right away. When answers are complex or involve a dialog with
          the questioners, collect them and respond at the end of the round.
          Avoid breaking the spirit of a round – don’t get into a lengthy
          discussion on one question in the middle of a round.</para>

          <para>There might not be a perfect way to do it, but the facilitator
          can decide <emphasis role="from-text">when</emphasis> questions are
          going to be answered. If there are many questions, the facilitator
          can initiate a second round because new information might also have
          triggered new questions. Do not forget – the overall aim of this
          step is to make sure everyone understands the original proposal or
          presentation. We only move to the next step when everyone is
          ready.</para>

          <para>Sometimes the facilitator<indexterm>
              <primary>facilitator</primary>
            </indexterm> will need to work with a circle member to tease out a
          real question that is mixed in with the member’s opinions.
          Reflecting back a question is a wonderful skill for any facilitator
          and it can sound like <emphasis role="from-text">“so, what I hear
          you say is that you would like to have clarity
          on….”</emphasis></para>

          <para>A challenge in the clarifying questions round is that
          sometimes people will jump ahead and give an opinion. Or they may
          express their negative judgment about the proposal through a biased
          question. A “question” (with potentially a lot of subtext) like
          <emphasis role="from-text">“why don’t you just…”</emphasis> is
          probably going down that path! If someone expresses an opinion, the
          facilitator can say things like:<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="from-text">“Thank you for sharing your
                opinion. Is there a question you would like to ask in order to

                note it down so it won’t be lost?”</emphasis></para>

                thoroughly. You will be able to share your opinion in a

          <emphasis role="from-text">if</emphasis> what people contribute

          <para>Time and attention span are often concerns in meetings. To

          reaction, I mean five sentences or less.”</emphasis> Some groups
          will find it supportive to use a talking stick and/or a timer to
          keep things moving in a round. Avoid repeating redundant
          information. One way to save time overall is to give everyone time
          to quietly write down what they would like to say <emphasis
          role="from-text">before</emphasis> the round starts. That way,
          everyone can be concise in their contribution.</para>

          <para>Whenever there is some new information, let the circle take

            </indexterm> is only facilitating – making process easier,
          “facile”. The facilitator is not supposed to be the savior of a
          group. A sociocratic meeting should feel like ping pong: there comes
          the ball and the facilitator bounces it back into the group. At the
          end, we do not even know who contributed what – it was all
          co-created. If we smash the ball every single time, we might win but
          the game will consist of people picking up the ball and there will
          be no flow.</para>

          <para>Consent rounds are very brief. They give only two
          options.<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="from-text">“I consent/I have no
                objections.”</emphasis></para>

                (because…)”</emphasis></para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>In the case of an objection, we can give a
          one-phrase statement about the objection, for example <emphasis
          role="from-text">“I have an objection to the time frame of
          this.”</emphasis></para>

          <para>Note that in consent decision making there is no third option
          of standing aside or passing. (See more on that in section <xref
          linkend="abstain" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber page"/>).</para>

          <para>We can get consent, especially on uncontroversial decisions
          (like for example a non-controversial agenda) in a non-verbal way.
          In that case, the facilitator has to make an effort to get brief eye
          contact with everyone in the group. In virtual meetings<indexterm>
              <primary>meeting</primary>

              <secondary>virtual meeting</secondary>
            </indexterm>, non-verbal consent can be given by showing our
          thumbs up.</para>

              <secondary>reaction round vs. consent round</secondary>
            </indexterm> is that after every explicit consent round, if there
          are no objections, a decision is made. We are not asking if people
          <emphasis role="from-text">would</emphasis> consent (which would be
          asking for a reaction) but we’re asking whether they <emphasis
          role="from-text">hereby</emphasis> consent.</para>

          <para>A consent round<indexterm>
              <primary>consent round</primary>
            </indexterm> is a special speech act; everyone has to be aware
          that we are not simply providing information but we are declaring a
          decision made. The facilitator<indexterm>
              <primary>facilitator</primary>
            </indexterm> has to be explicit about this – have you been to
          meetings where afterward, there were different opinions on whether a
          decision was just considered or made? That’s the difference we are
          talking about here. Be clear! Say something like <emphasis
          role="from-text">“So, the proposal is that …, and I will now ask you
          for your consent. Do you consent to this
          proposal?”</emphasis></para>

                  </indexterm> for a while. It is best to be intentional about
                this, however. Once people are “conditioned” to only talking
                when it is their turn, they might remain silent in a free flow
                discussion. For that reason, it is important to be explicit:
                <emphasis role="from-text">“I propose we spend the next 10
                minutes in free flow conversation and see if that brings up
                any new ideas.”</emphasis> End your free flow time with a
                round to re-establish equivalence and to understand where the
                circle is at as a whole.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>

          <para>We encourage groups to make rounds their default and to be
          intentional about deviating from that default. However, it is also a
          matter of practice – and the more a group practices, the better they
          will get at it.</para>

          <title>If a circle member gets upset during a meeting</title>

          <para>What can a circle do if one member of the circle gets too
          upset to continue the meeting? This might show in uncooperative
          disruptive behavior, displays of anger, like yelling or getting up
          from the chair. Ways to respond depend on (1) the capacity of that
          circle member in that moment to be self-responsible and (2) the
          time, resource and willingness of the other circle members to take
          time off the meeting to hear the underlying needs. Do not assume you
          need to interrupt the work of the meeting to deal with emotional
          reactivity. Consider the circumstances and be intentional.</para>

          finds itself in the middle of a meta-discussion that eats up meeting

                timekeeper. We might want to explain in a blame-free way that
                timekeeping is helpful for everyone, for example by saying

        <para>“Turn and talk” is a technique where we let two people (or a

        emotions are high, the topic is complex and/or the group is large.
        Turn and talk benefits from being limited to a certain duration, like
        one minute for each person in the pair.</para>

        <para>With a turn and talk, a circle member has more time and space to
        think out loud about the topic before sharing an opinion in a round.
        Having done a turn and talk, circle members are able to state their

        <para>In synchronous virtual meetings, we hold a meeting in a video
        conference. The meeting is online but everyone is there at the same
        time. The advantages of sociocratic meetings for online contexts
        are:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Clarity of talking turns. Especially rounds work well in
              virtual meetings. Most people can mute their microphone until
              their turn comes. Since we do not want to engage in
              cross-talk<indexterm>
                  <primary>cross-talk</primary>
                </indexterm>, being on a muted computer actually supports
              rounds. Rounds even make it doable to have meetings where some
              are online, some are in a room together. We do not risk leaving
              out the ones on the screen because they have their turn in the
              round.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>It is easier to show real-time notes in a virtual meeting.
              We always have two windows on our screen during video
              conferences; one window shows the people, the other shows the
              agenda and real-time minute-taking. That way, if a circle
              develops content or someone makes a proposal during a meeting,
              that content will be visible to everyone. We always have full
              transparency<indexterm>
                  <primary>transparency</primary>
                </indexterm> and full access to information. We find ourselves
              missing that option in offline meetings! (One might choose to
              use a projector to show the real-time notes in an in-person
              meeting but then people are looking at a screen instead of each
              other.)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>We also find that rounds make it fairly easy to be present
              with each other in virtual meetings even with reduced
              information. We might not be able to read the other people’s
              energy as easily as in an in-person meeting but rounds slow down
              and condense the meeting enough that we can work confidently
              with the cues we are getting.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>One side note: when having a meeting with members in different
        time zones, the easiest thing to do is to keep the time information on
        the agenda as neutral as possible. We always start the meeting
        information with zero because we work in conference calls with people
        in different time zones – 0:00 marks the beginning of the meeting,
        whatever time it might be for individual members in their time zone.
        We can see at a glimpse how many minutes into the meeting we are at
        any moment. Also, it helps for not putting the facilitator’s time zone
        as the “standard”.</para>

        </indexterm>

        <para>Asynchronous decision making is very different from synchronous
        virtual meetings. Asynchronous decision making is when a proposal is
        approved by each circle member consenting to it at a different time.
        This can happen, for example, by email, or on given online
        platforms.</para>

        <para>Our experience with asynchronous decision making is mixed and we
        avoid it and only use it for very defined decisions in circles that
        know each other well.</para>

        <para>Before addressing this, let us review the distinction between
        (policy) decision making, operational decisions<indexterm>
            <primary>decision</primary>

            <secondary>operational decision</secondary>
          </indexterm> and giving feedback. Policy decisions are made by
        consent and we need everyone’s consent in the circle.
        Feedback<indexterm>
            <primary>feedback</primary>
          </indexterm> is just content that might be input for a decision in
        the future. Operational decisions are small decisions that apply to a
        particular situation.<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>It is very easy to give input in an asynchronous way. For
              example, we would ask everyone in a circle (or beyond a circle)
              to give their input on an issue, a needs statement<indexterm>
                  <primary>needs statement</primary>
                </indexterm>, a proposal draft or similar content. People can
              add their information over time, and they might build on each
              other’s input (if it is visible to everyone what others have
              already written).</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Operational decisions can be made very easily in an
              asynchronous context if we have a good sense of who needs to be
              asked/informed.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>It can be hard to make a good consent decision
              asynchronously, especially when the decision is complex. For
              consent, we need to hear from everyone. We want deliberation to
              happen. Deliberation by email or in online platforms often turns
              into ‘‘decisions by those who spend the most time writing on
              their computer’’. Asynchronous decision making can work but it
              can very easily miss out on the advantages of consent decision
              making that create and nourish connection: equivalence<indexterm>
                  <primary>equivalence</primary>
                </indexterm> (for example, how much we hear from every circle
              member), dialogue and deliberation, moving forward as a group,
              working through objections while being connected. All the
              advantages that rounds and connection bring to decision making
              can be lost in asynchronous decision making if we do not design
              and use it with a lot of care.</para>

        <secondary>power structure</secondary>
      </indexterm>power structure has to have both elements of <emphasis

    the staff would welcome a change toward shared power. Introducing shared
    power <emphasis role="from-text">top-down</emphasis> – even done with the
    best intentions – uses power-over. That will not only lead to skepticism,
    it also starts off the idea of shared power on the wrong foot. We often
    work with people who are enthusiastic about sociocracy and who would love
    to wave the magic wand and get everyone on board, because, after all, it

        <para>In a sociocratic mindset, we are all equals. We cannot start a
        sociocratic implementation<indexterm>
            <primary>implementation</primary>
          </indexterm> coming from a place of righteousness because dividing
        up the world into “right” and “wrong” is not going to be effective.
        That means, the implementation of sociocracy starts even before we say
        the first word about sociocracy. It starts <emphasis
        role="from-text">in our minds</emphasis>. Will we be able to hear
        people’s fear with an open heart and with willingness to work with
        their objections?</para>

        <para>We have seen people burning for sociocracy and encountering
        nothing but resistance – and it seemed like the resistance came
        <emphasis role="from-text">because</emphasis> they were so
        enthusiastic. One reason for that is that some people hear criticism
        as soon as we bring up the possibility of any new system. We can say
        <emphasis role="from-text">“there is this cool way of decision making
        called consent”</emphasis>, and people <emphasis
        role="from-text">hear</emphasis> <emphasis role="from-text">“what you
        are doing now is wrong”</emphasis>. There is no point in going there.
        Other forms of governance are not wrong. Chances are they are less

            <primary>equivalence</primary>

              listening skills and their ability to work with objections. We

        always encourage people to bring a second person, for the simple

        shared, and the journey will be shared from the beginning.</para>

        <para>Remember not to let the organization fall into camps. We want to
        overcome the distinction between those in power and those without.
        Everyone wants to have a say in matters that concern them. Everyone
        wants to be able to contribute to what is important to them. Everyone
        wants to be more connected to their co-workers. This is true both for
        workers and managers. This is not something we have to “sell”. We
        assume that everyone carries that longing already because it comes
        from universal needs. In our experience, we all agree that change is
        needed. However, not all of us have hope that positive change can be
        done. More and more people are ready to do things differently. We
        start from the assumption that we already have shared interests. We

        something better is enough of a motivator. For some of us, at times,
        we need to feel pain to a breaking point before we are willing to risk
        change. When one person tells you about sociocracy, you might think,
        <emphasis role="from-text">“oh, that is interesting”</emphasis>, and
        promptly forget it. When the third person from different parts of your
        life tell you about sociocracy, you might think, <emphasis

        attention to”</emphasis>. At some point, each of us opens to change.

      <para>There are so many ways sociocracy may be introduced to
      organizations. From the inside or the outside. In a start-up or in an
      established organization. To an organization that is working well and
      wants to work even more in line with its values or to an organization
      that is in deep pain with its finances, its interpersonal dynamics, and
      its productivity. We start here with a step-by-step approach to
      introducing sociocracy to an established organization. The sequence of
      steps is not strict, and many of the steps are repeated in different
      ways or different levels. This list is framed from the perspective of
      someone inside the organization and is intended to give you a sense of
      scope and strategy for the process of introducing sociocracy. We are
      going to present mostly the same list to you in two formats because
      different people think in different ways (even the co-authors!). The

      homelessness by building houses for and with the homeless in this region
      of this country. (See more on mission and aims in section <xref
      linkend="VMAD" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber page"/>.) To (mission) by
      (aim). The mission plus aim is the invitation. You can now call for
      people to join you as volunteers or as paid staff. They know what they
      would be doing and why. Next, make your aims ever more specific. One
      product or service or many. Who are the customers? Design the <emphasis
      role="from-text">input – transformation – output</emphasis> workflow
      doing picture forming and proposal shaping. To get to the desired
      output, what resources (people, skills, raw materials, tools, funding,
      etc.) will you need? How will you organize the work? What roles and
      subcircles do you need? Who will fill them?</para>

      <para>The first circle will have as input the <emphasis

      role="from-text">domain<indexterm>
          <primary>domain</primary>
        </indexterm></emphasis> of the circle, its members, and its resources.
      In order to function well, we need to define process and operational
      roles and fill them. Not all of those steps have to be completed in the
      first meeting, but over time, each needs to be addressed. For securing
      the input, make sure everyone understands the aim and domain. Consent
      (or object and resolve) to the initial circle members. Consent to the
      leader<indexterm>
          <primary>leader</primary>

          <secondary>parent circle</secondary>
        </indexterm> or if no formal leader exists, select one. Select people
      into the roles of facilitator, secretary and delegate. That completes
      the basic sociocratic structure of the circle. Then it is time to
      operationalize the aim of the circle: define the workflow that will get
      the work done, set policies that will give both freedom and limits to
      how the work gets done, and define and fill operational roles<indexterm>

      <para>With success, a simple start-up organization can grow in
      complexity quickly. Suddenly, we need a website, a social media outlet,
      a logo, design guidelines, an HR department, accounting …and it never
      stops. The step from a beginning organization to a running organization
      is huge. That is why we recommend starting sociocratic governance right
      away. The easiest way to implement sociocracy is in a start-up. The
      easiest way to grow is with sociocracy or related, dynamic,
      decentralized systems.</para>

      <para>A sociocratic organization grows from one small circle to a
      full-fledged structure with many circles. (See section <xref
      linkend="startupphase" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> on sociocracy
      in growing organizations.) Starting sociocracy in a new organization
      means one will have to convince fewer people in the beginning when
      introducing sociocracy because there are not as many decision-makers
      yet. In this context, it is important to be open and transparent about
      your governance system. For some young organizations, the effort of
      onboarding<indexterm>
          <primary>onboarding</primary>
        </indexterm> new members is significant, given that it is unlikely
      that new members come with experience in sociocracy. One can have the
      best implementation<indexterm>
          <primary>implementation</primary>
        </indexterm> in the world but if trained members are outnumbered by
      new members who do not know enough about it to care, the organization
      will slowly drift back toward the mainstream culture. It takes intention
      and action to keep a new governance system alive.</para>

        <para>It’s possible to start an organization with one circle of

            <secondary>circle structure</secondary>
          </indexterm> in the beginning. As the need arises, the groups will
        differentiate. For example, the group will notice what topics are only
        affecting some in the group. They might also, quite naturally,
        outsource tasks that are best done by an individual or a pair in an
        operational role<indexterm>

        <para>If there is just one circle, is that a work circle, or the
        General Circle? At the early stage, there is no difference. Think of
        it in terms of domains. The General Circle<indexterm>
            <primary>general circle</primary>
          </indexterm> is the “super”-circle for all the work circles and
        “owns” the overall domain for the overall aim. When the time is right,
        we create sub-circles and pass part of the general circle aims/domains
        to them.</para>

        <para>The figures in <xref linkend="metamorphosis"

        getting together, forming a group and deciding to start a business. At
        first, they might all more or less do the same tasks. Quickly,
        however, they will each have their work area of preference or
        expertise. One does marketing, one builds the website, one writes
        pitches to find investors, two build the product. They might still
        make all the policy decisions<indexterm>
            <primary>decision</primary>

            <secondary>policy decision</secondary>
          </indexterm> together. <emphasis role="from-text">“Should they pay
        for ads, should they build the website themselves or hire it out? Who
        needs to be asked before someone can spend money?”</emphasis> On the
        governance end, this means they all still hold all the domains
        together, they just define <emphasis role="from-text">“ok, you go
        ahead and carry out our marketing plan”</emphasis> or <emphasis
        role="from-text">“ok, you go and find someone who will build our

        together <emphasis role="from-text">how</emphasis> they are going to
        go about interviewing potential customers to find out what their needs
        are, but only one or two of them are going to work on it. The policy
        is made together in the whole group, while the operations<indexterm>

        Circle. Many groups fail because they are not able to take the step of
        delegating. If founding members still want to keep their fingers in
        everything, they will run into the <indexterm>
            <primary>founder issues</primary>

        <para>Some organizations only implement some elements of sociocracy.
        While there is nothing wrong with that, the advantage of implementing

        general circle<indexterm>
            <primary>general circle</primary>
          </indexterm> if we have leaders and delegates. Having a delegate
        only makes sense if there is a general circle, and all of those

              <para>Not all ‘‘standard’’ pieces of sociocracy are being used

              even majority vote within a sociocratic circle structure. One

                </indexterm> processes but not for other decisions. Any piece

              missed. As in a human body, every system has its purpose. For

                  <primary>performance review</primary>
                </indexterm> might miss out on improvements on an individual

              board or any equivalent mission circle might miss direction for
              its long-term trajectory. An organization that never does
              check-ins at the beginning of a meeting might experience their
              own meetings as impersonal, without the sense of connection and
              belonging that improves performance.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Only some departments or units in the organization are

              that changes in leadership at higher levels of the organization

        an even better version of governance. From a shared aim and a shared
        process, one can continue a sociocratic journey by choosing tools:
        consent, linked circles, sociocratic elections. Rounds are a good
        strategy for including everyone’s voice early. Having at least

        Some people may become disillusioned with a partial or incremental
        implementation when the benefits of sociocracy are not quickly
        observable or existing organizational problems are not quickly
        resolved - they may then conclude that sociocracy doesn’t work. In

        benefits of adopting sociocracy more thoroughly.</para>

      <indexterm>
        <primary>organization</primary>

        <secondary>volunteer organization</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Both in paid and in volunteer contexts, working together has to be
      productive and efficient or we are losing money, energy, or volunteers
      themselves. Just as paid workers want to have a say in their work
      environment, volunteers may have a desire for that as well. For
      governance, there is no difference between a paid and an unpaid
      environment. Treat your volunteers like paid staff – have a contract
      that outlines how the organization will benefit the volunteer, how
      volunteers will benefit the organization, which defines what the rights
      and responsibilities of volunteers in the organization are. “Pay”
      volunteers with feedback about the impact of their work, opportunities
      for learning, and a sense of belonging and connection. Expect volunteers
      to be accountable to their commitments.</para>

      <para>In a mixed paid and volunteer organization, a typical concern is
      that either or both a paid person filling a role of a volunteer
      coordinator could have too much power or carry too much of an
      organizational burden. A sociocratic organization that includes both
      paid workers and volunteers can work effectively to resolve their
      dilemmas when both share the responsibilities of decision making.</para>

      <para>What do we have to keep in mind if we mix paid staff and
      volunteers in one organization? Again, for the governance aspect,
      anything works. Sociocracy is about who does what and who decides what,
      not about who gets paid for their work. Whether or not volunteers in a
      mixed organization are decision-makers will depend on their level of
      involvement.</para>

      <para>If we can ‘‘hire’’ a volunteer, can we also ‘‘fire’’ them? It
      follows from the general principles of membership<indexterm>
          <primary>circle</primary>

          <secondary>circle membership</secondary>
        </indexterm><indexterm>
          <primary>membership</primary>

          <secondary>membership in a circle</secondary>
        </indexterm> of circles (a circle can choose its members) that we have
      to be able to remove people from circles (see section <xref
      linkend="removesomeone" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>). This is true
      no matter whether that person is paid or not. That means we might be in
      a situation where we “fire” a volunteer because working with them
      negatively affects the circle’s ability to work toward their aim. Some
      find that hard to do because we want to be grateful for anyone putting
      in their volunteer time. However, remember that any organization based
      on consent requires its members to be accountable and constructive. If
      someone’s behavior is slowing down the circle significantly, it might be
      better to let that person go.</para>

      <para>We can remove someone from a circle or a role and ask them to do
      other jobs within the same organization. In this case, we are not
      excluding them as a member – we might even hold them in appreciation as
      members of the organization while removing them from one particular
      circle. For example, someone might be the best cook and volunteer
      coordinator in a soup kitchen but drive people away as a fundraiser.
      This person might still be part of the meal or volunteer coordination
      circle but not the fundraising circle.</para>

      <para>How can we include new members in a sociocratic system, especially
      in a volunteer context? It is harder to require training on sociocratic
      governance for volunteers because their involvement might be lower and
      more fluid. Someone told us about volunteers in a community garden,
      <emphasis role="from-text">“the people don’t want to be trained in
      decision making, they are here to dig in the dirt.”</emphasis> Our
      response was: <emphasis role="from-text">“Well, someone still has to
      make the decisions, and if they want to make them for themselves, they
      will need a framework to do it in.”</emphasis> Volunteers work within
      the context of the organization’s policies. Organizations need to be
      clear in their policies about which level of volunteering qualifies for
      decision making and which levels of volunteering welcome feedback but no
      decision-making rights. If volunteers have decision-making rights, then
      they need training and education<indexterm>
          <primary>education around governance</primary>

          <secondary>for volunteers</secondary>
        </indexterm> about sociocracy just like any paid staff member.</para>

      <para>Another way to include volunteers in an organization is as a
      stakeholder group. Volunteers have a stake in the well-being and
      effectiveness of the organization they contribute their time to. They
      have in interested in their work having meaning and they have an
      interest in how they are treated as volunteers. A circle of volunteers
      representing the interests of volunteers can be double linked with the
      Mission Circle. The leader of the Mission Circle (or other selected
      person) would serve as the leader of the Volunteer Circle and one or
      more delegates selected by the Volunteer Circle would serve on the
      Mission Circle,.Alternatively, a Volunteer Circle could be a sub-circle
      of the General Circle or any other organizational circle. In that
      context the Volunteer Circle would have its own aim and domain and
      relevant activity and authority like any other circle of the
      organization.</para>

      <para>The advantage of breaking up into circles is to keep every meeting

        </indexterm> gets the attention it needs. The general circle<indexterm>

      <para>Here is another very subtle advantage of having the clarity of
      domains and <indexterm>
          <primary>aim</primary>
        </indexterm>aims and who holds which domain: it is easier to recruit
      prospective members if they have a clear choice about where to put their
      energy. The question to them is not: <emphasis role="from-text">“do you
      want to join a group that does events, social media, a mailing list and
      permaculture?”</emphasis> The question becomes <emphasis

          <primary>volunteer</primary>

      feel more confident to join.</para>

      <para>In tiny organizations, there is a tendency to have circles that

        </itemizedlist>What is the difference between a circle of one and a
      person who holds a role in a circle? The general answer is that circles
      make policy whereas roles carry out policy. But the difference can get
      blurry. A circle of one with a narrow aim and domain may not be much
      different than a person in a role with a broad aim and domain of
      decision making that in other circles or organizations would be
      considered policy. In the end, what is significant is not the identity
      as circle of one or as role filler but how well values of effectiveness
      and egalitarianism are being served by the way we conceptualize the
      identity.</para>

      Sociocracy is designed to let workers make decisions about their own

      falls short.</para>

        <para>This is the option that has served organizations like the
        neighborhood parliaments in India where hundreds of thousands of
        families are connected in linked circles. Each member, by being part
        of a forum that is small enough so everyone can be heard, has a voice

        Think, for example, a social media platform like Twitter being

        alternative. There simply aren’t as many decisions to be made, and
        tasks to be performed as there are members. A platform cooperative has

        policy. Here are some thoughts about this dilemma:<itemizedlist>

        <para>A sociocratic IT business we are aware of created a transparent
        system of including all employees over time by replacing circle
        members with new members on a defined term so that every 2-3 years,
        every member has been part of a circle. This is a useful idea to give
        more people the experience of being in a circle, understanding how the
        decisions are made. This option can be combined with the two other
        options. It requires trust, transparency and a clear way of how to

      <para>Some people rule out sociocracy for legal reasons, for example
      because their legal form seems to determine what options they have in

      <para>Owners of for-profit organizations usually have control of their
      organizations by direct ownership or by majority vote of the
      shareholders and/or their Boards of Directors. Nonprofit organizations
      and volunteer associations are usually controlled by majority vote of
      their Board of Directors. Sociocratic organizations are not owned and
      controlled by anyone because of decision making by consent and the
      double-linking circular organizational structure. The sociocratic
      organization owns itself. Without the fear of power-over control,
      investors can be welcomed because they bring needed funds to the
      organization. Hostile takeovers or unwelcome moves of operations
      overseas are no longer possible. In nonprofit contexts where funders
      replace investors, funders are welcome as partners rather than dominant
      or absent outsiders, and the measure of effectiveness<indexterm>
          <primary>effectiveness</primary>
        </indexterm> includes both the well-being of workers and the degree of
      positive impact on society. A sociocratic organization needs to have
      sociocratic principles and practices stated in the organization’s
      articles of incorporation, partnership agreements, by-laws and/or any
      other documents that define the legal entity. A sample set of bylaws for

        <secondary>typical pitfalls in implementation</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Learning <emphasis role="from-text">about</emphasis> sociocracy is
      very different from running a sociocratic organization. And <emphasis
      role="from-text">implementing</emphasis> sociocracy is very different
      from having a well-running governance system in place. At any stage of
      the implementation, there can be pitfalls that are unexpected for the
      novice. After seeing many organizations implement sociocracy and
      sometimes struggle, we can identify some typical pitfalls. After all,
      offering this manual poses a risk for its authors: the risk that people
      take this book, implement sociocracy in an organization, fail, and then
      broadcast a claim that “sociocracy does not work”.</para>

      <para>We have seen sociocracy work and many others have too. But like a
      perfect human body sometimes needs help, organizations are organisms
      with a lot of complexity that might need support. Organizations are
      self-repairing, but only in the ideal case of everyone having full
      expertise and perfect awareness (i.e. no blind spots of their own).
      Reading through this manual so far is like reading a book about biology
      – now it is time for some first aid education! We want to tell readers
      the typical symptoms of an “ill” organization to enable them to
      self-diagnose. Depending on the gravity of an issue, practitioners might
      be able to “treat” the issue themselves, or they might consult with
      governance “doctors”.</para>

      <para>What are the most common diseases? The tricky thing is that one
      symptom of stuck governance is that we get triggered, for example we get
      stressed, overwhelmed, upset, overworked or burned out, maybe scared.
      That might interfere with your ability to say <emphasis
      role="from-text">“oh, that’s a governance issue. We have been giving the
      general circle too much power and that’s why we feel this
      way”</emphasis>. Many typical struggles that upset people are governance
      issues: people who talk too long, lack of accountability, people
      stepping on each other’s toes, tasks falling through the cracks – the
      list is long. Remember how feelings are pointers to met or unmet needs?
      (See section <xref linkend="feelings"
      xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>.) Whenever someone gets upset in the
      context of an organization, consider that there might be a governance
      issue one could address. Did someone give feedback?<indexterm>
          <primary>feedback</primary>
        </indexterm> How can similar issues be prevented next time?</para>

      <para>If we could wave a magic wand, we would have readers review this
      chapter on a regular basis. Practitioners would read it every few months
      in a new implementation<indexterm>
          <primary>implementation</primary>

          <secondary>implementation phase</secondary>
        </indexterm>, or they would read it every year to make sure they are
      still on track. Some of these “diseases” develop slowly over time. Once
      they are chronic, it gets harder to treat them. Groups can decide to
      check in with a “governance doctor” on a regular basis (i.e., a retainer
      arrangement), like a yearly physical for the health of your organization
      and the well-being of its members. An organization’s governance is part
      of the organizational culture and the interpersonal relationships, which
      are a core asset of any organization.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Issues that the organization had before</title>

        <para>Sociocracy can support member involvement and
        effectiveness<indexterm>
            <primary>effectiveness</primary>
          </indexterm> (potentially leading to a more stable financial
        situation), ideally leading to a self-governed organization that can
        identify weak spots. It will be resilient and innovative, and heal
        itself. However, implementing sociocracy does <emphasis
        role="from-text">not</emphasis> solve issues that are outside of the
        scope of governance. If the business plan is not viable, or funding is
        not solid, then a sociocratic organization will fail just as any
        traditionally governed organization. If communication skills are low,
        then those need to be addressed, or the organization may fail.</para>

        <para>Sociocracy will not help if an organization is already having
        very deep issues. It is not a magic bullet. To stay in the metaphor of
        diseases: surgery can be life-saving. However, when a patient is very
        weak, the life-saving surgery can be too much and can kill the patient
        earlier than he would have died without surgery. Or, as a colleague
        said, in reference to our analogy of learning how to swim, “when
        someone is drowning, it is not the time to teach how to swim”.
        Changing the governance system in times of crisis can add another
        level of complication that brings the organization over the
        edge.</para>

        <para>When implementing sociocracy, it’s good to ask whether this is a
        good time or whether there are other serious issues not related to
        governance that need to be addressed. If one ignores other serious
        issues, the implementation<indexterm>
            <primary>implementation</primary>
          </indexterm> will fail just as fast as the organization will.</para>

        <para>We know from experience that struggling organizations often have
        more than one chronic issue. We <emphasis
        role="from-text">can</emphasis>, with outside help, identify areas
        where tools from sociocracy might be helpful. Training facilitators in
        sociocracy, for example, can give a lot of benefits with only little
        investment or change.</para>

            <primary>implementation</primary>
          </indexterm> of sociocracy. The combination of individualism and
        victim mindset can be toxic for community and for sociocracy. In
        majority rule organizations, different factions may be accustomed to
        manipulating for control of power and they may see sociocracy as
        another system to be manipulated. In for-profit organizations, the
        distrust based on the historical management-labor divide may be quite
        a barrier to overcome.</para>

          <title>The case of trial periods</title>

            <primary>implementation</primary>

            <secondary>trial periods</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>Some organizations implementing sociocracy start with a trial
          period. They want to try out sociocracy for 6 months and then
          evaluate. This sounds like a good idea, and sounds even very much
          aligned with sociocracy – try out a proposal for a certain time
          frame, evaluate and then decide how to proceed.</para>

          <para>There is a subtle difference between ordinary proposals in a
          sociocratic organization and implementing sociocracy in a trial
          version. Since with sociocracy, we also change the method used for
          decision making, it has to be very clear what the decision making
          is, with which we decide whether or not to extend or end the trial.
          What does the organization fall back into? Imagine a consensus-run
          organization implementing sociocracy for half a year. What
          decision-making method do they use to decide whether they are
          continuing -- consensus or consent? How are we going to treat
          objections<indexterm>
              <primary>objection</primary>

              <secondary>objections during trial periods</secondary>
            </indexterm> to using sociocracy as a governance method?
          Especially in a consensus situation where some people might still be
          attached to the powerful position of the minority, one can end up in
          a position where those who feel threatened by the concept of consent
          decision making will undermine the trial period, making it
          impossible to experience how consent <emphasis
          role="from-text">could</emphasis> be, and then using it against
          sociocracy’s case when the time for evaluation has come. In a way,
          even if we wished it were different (given that short-time
          experiments are our favorite tool for dealing with objections!), we
          have come to the conclusion that there is no trial for governance
          systems like sociocracy.</para>

          <para>Instead of a trial period, do a proposal like figure <xref
          linkend="implementationpolicy"
          xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>.</para>

          <figure xml:id="implementationpolicy">

              </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
          </figure>

          <para>This is something we have learned from experience. Referring
          back to the preconditions of consent: sociocracy requires
          willingness to talk until objections are integrated<indexterm>
              <primary>objection</primary>

              <secondary>willingness to integrate objections</secondary>
            </indexterm>. In a trial period, we are leaving a back door open.
          We will <emphasis role="from-text">not</emphasis> be truly open to
          working things out which means the organization’s members are going
          to engage in a self-fulfilling prophecy of “consent does not work”.
          Putting an entire organization through a yes/no trial period may not
          provide realistic data. Consent only works when we accept that
          working things out as equals and with honest curiosity is the only
          way of relating to each other. If the group is not ready to accept
          that, one might have to find the small-scale experiment that the
          group <emphasis role="from-text">can</emphasis> say “yes” to. It
          will provide the data that is needed so everyone can say “yes” to
          consent decision making for the whole organization.</para>

          <para>Implementing sociocracy has to be aligned with the values of
          sociocracy. One of them is that circles need authority over their
          <indexterm>
              <primary>domain</primary>

              <secondary>authority in domain</secondary>
            </indexterm>domain. What is meant by that is <emphasis
          role="from-text">full</emphasis> authority. The circle needs to be
          the only and ultimate decision-maker in their domain. Imagine a
          sociocratically run department in a big corporation that itself is
          <emphasis role="from-text">not</emphasis> run sociocratically. They
          might be able to <emphasis role="from-text">pretend</emphasis> to be
          in power but they do not have ultimate decision-power. The
          corporation can close down the experiment, or the company sold,
          without the department having any say.</para>

          <para>Sociocratic organizations own themselves. As long as <emphasis
          role="from-text">anyone else</emphasis> has power over the
          organization, it cannot own itself. Shifting power is not cosmetic,
          and in our world, it is not just a fad for squeezing more
          productivity out of happier employees. This is not (only) about
          productivity. It is about deep change, and not all environments
          might be suitable for it at first. We do not discourage sociocratic
          experiments in corporate departments or in non-profits where the
          board – or the founder – is not buying in on the governance system.
          We are just aware of the experiment’s vulnerability and ask
          departments to protect themselves from that uncertainty. In our
          view, this is also true if a single owner has the power to install
          (and therefore also to withdraw) a governance method.</para>

        <para>In sociocracy, circle membership has to be clearly defined. We
        have to know who is in and who is out. If we do not, we will have
        people dropping in and out of circles. For decision-making groups,
        this is a problem. If we do not know who is a member and who is not,
        we also do not know who needs to consent, which means we won’t be able
        to hear all the objections or we will be distracted by objections from
        people who are not members.</para>

        <para>There is more: we will not know who has access, for example to
        money in the circle’s budget<indexterm>
            <primary>budget</primary>
          </indexterm>. Lack of defined membership makes it hard to be
        transparent (we do not know what they are thinking because they are
        not there, and they do not know what we are thinking), effective (we
        risk waiting for them because we think they might come back) and to
        speak with equal consideration. We cannot make a decision with every
        circle member in mind if some of the circle members are frequently
        absent – to an extent that we do not know whether they still consider
        themselves a member.</para>

        <para>Lack of defined membership is a problem mainly for volunteer

            <primary>volunteer organization</primary>
          </indexterm>. In paid contexts, often, people are hired to fill a
        role which automatically puts them into a certain circle. However, the
        following scenario can happen almost anywhere. Imagine a circle that
        has worked on a proposal, with one circle member being absent
        (unexcused, maybe) for three meetings. The circle is led to believe
        that this member has dropped out but lacked the intentionality to
        follow up to hear what is going on. Now the proposal is ready to be
        consented to, and our missing circle member shows up, still
        considering herself a member – and objects to the proposal. This can
        be frustrating and disheartening and can easily lead to volunteers
        losing their interest in working in the organization. In short,
        defined circle membership is a must for all decision-making
        groups.</para>

        <para>Excusing absences and follow-ups if someone missed a meeting has
        to be part of the organization’s culture. The person to follow up on
        this will be the circle leader and the person who missed the meeting.
        A circle can decide to put a circle member on leave. (In that case,

        differently.<informalexample>
            <para>Let us look at the example of a social enterprise that
            produces fair trade chocolate and lobbies for fair trade. One aim
            is to create more opportunity for workers in the fair trade
            industry, one is to produce chocolate. Those two aims are not in
            conflict with each other; we can do both. But if we have a surplus
            to re-invest – does this go into extending the production, or does
            it go into education around fair trade?</para>
          </informalexample>We are not stuck in conflict forever <emphasis
        role="from-text">if</emphasis> we see that a divergence on the

            <primary>aim</primary>

            <secondary>clarity on the aim</secondary>
          </indexterm>aim is what is going on. If we realize the reason
        underlying the struggle, we have a choice of re-stating our aim or to
        split into two organizations, each with its own distinct aim. For
        example, one organization’s aim of producing fair trade chocolate and
        the other’s to lobby for fair trade. Either solution might be better
        than to spin our wheels and to wear out fighting the battle and
        hitting the same wall again and again.</para>

        <para>In a similar way, domains benefit from clarity. In section <xref
        linkend="hierachyofdomains" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>, we
        described how two domains should neither have overlap nor gaps between
        them.<informalexample>
            <para>Imagine a fridge in a bakery café. Does the Front Desk
            Circle maintain the baked goods in the front desk fridge, or the
            circle that produces the baked goods?</para>
          </informalexample>Imagine nobody doing it – then we’d have baked
        goods out of date in the fridge. Imagine <emphasis

        Then they would step on each other’s toes. This would either lead to
        resentment and frustration around doubled work, or un-doing each
        other’s efforts. Obviously, neither is a desirable outcome. Most
        likely, everyone would be willing to define the <indexterm>
            <primary>domain</primary>
          </indexterm>domain without gaps.<remark> Should the sentences up to
        here be included in the preceding `informalexample`?</remark> The
        trick is to remember what the effects of lack of clarity about domains
        and aims looks like, so we can respond with intentionality.</para>

        <para>The signal for both lack of clarity of domain and for lack of
        congruency of the aim<indexterm>
            <primary>aim</primary>
          </indexterm> is the same: the same issue keeps coming up in
        different ways. If there are recurring issues about the same topic, it
        is time to get curious. What might be underlying these recurring
        struggles? Might it be related to how each member understands the aims
        or domains? Change can then come from a place of understanding and

        <title>Paying too little attention</title>

        <para>A new governance method requires some attention. We have seen
        organizations declare sociocracy hoping for easy transition. We do not
        see this work. This section outlines the typical areas that require
        attention.</para>

        <section xml:id="underestimate">
          <title>Underestimating the prevailing culture</title>

          <para>Sociocracy means culture change. Especially in existing,
          hierarchical organizations this cannot be underestimated. That
          culture change includes questions of identity, power-over and
          power-under. There is a huge learning to do for everyone as we
          question how we have been doing things, who we are, and what is
          driving us. Be prepared, eyes wide open, for intense feelings around
          topics of power!</para>

          <para>There are some judgements that are held as truths very widely
          and that make it hard to accept sociocracy as an
          option.<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Judgment: <emphasis role="from-text">“People do not want
                to/cannot take on responsibility.”</emphasis></para>

                <para>Although it is true that some people find peace in not
                having too much responsibility from time to time, it is easy
                in sociocracy to keep the scope of responsibility at a level
                that works for members. We disagree with the original
                statement in that we assume that everyone wants <indexterm>

                    <secondary>power in one’s world</secondary>
                  </indexterm>power in their world, even this ‘‘world’’ is
                just a piece of the organization. It is about the hat we wear:
                while I might be executive director in my day job, I might
                want to just hammer nails in my volunteer<indexterm>
                    <primary>volunteer</primary>
                  </indexterm> work, without shouldering too much
                responsibility. That is fine. We tend to think of some people
                as ‘‘natural’’ leaders but it not realistic for every
                ‘‘natural leader’’ to be leader in all their organizations and
                contexts. At the same time, an organization needs more than
                ‘‘natural leadership’’. Through the layers of circles,
                everyone can operate at the level of abstractness or
                specificity that works for them at that moment and in that
                part of their life. It is also possible to wear multiple hats.
                In our own community, we hold roles as cartwright (very
                specific) and cleaning windows of the community building. We
                also have very abstract jobs, such as member of the General
                Circle<indexterm>
                    <primary>general circle</primary>
                  </indexterm> or as leader of the Governance Improvement
                Circle. In the role as window-cleaner, I do not want to have
                the well-being of the community over the next 5 years on my
                mind – I am cleaning windows so all I think about is how to
                clean them, as service to my community.</para>

                <para>Roles and circles give us a more fine-grained, dynamic
                way of working together. We can be flexible in our personal
                development. We can start small and grow into
                leadership<indexterm>
                    <primary>leadership</primary>
                  </indexterm>, or we can let go of responsibilities. Our
                commitment and the specificity of work we choose will
                fluctuate over time, making it possible to give up
                responsibility when life pulls us in a different direction for
                a while. This commitment can be shaped according to our needs
                and the needs of the organization. A dynamic organization lets
                us be flexible. This flexibility is the strength of the
                dynamic governance system, and it makes it uniquely human as
                well.</para>

                can be asked for their input – sociocracy does not limit flow

                groups. In small groups rounds increase clarity and reduce
                debates. Just learning rounds, some find it hard at first, and
                then they fall in love with the level of insights it gives
                them into other people’s perspectives. Over time, people
                appreciate the input we gain from hearing from everyone, and
                how it makes decisions better over time. The mutual respect
                leads to a more pleasant organizational culture which pays

                <para>Some people are turned off by the presence of structure.
                It can be a problem if people are slowed down because they are

                process’’. Typically, however, this is a matter of practice
                and gets much easier very quickly. We can support this by

                    <primary>education around governance</primary>
                  </indexterm> on a continuing basis. Let us consider the

                    <primary>power</primary>
                  </indexterm> is never absent, not in a world where people
                have grown up in a system of power. The tyranny of
                structurelessness is real. We want to think of power as
                something positive. With intentionality, this power can be
                harvested, shared and steered, to everyone’s benefit.</para>

          power<indexterm>
              <primary>power</primary>
            </indexterm> dynamics: privileges of all kinds are either on the
          surface or very close to it. We all carry our experience of power.
          Most people, especially those who have had less-than-average access
          to privilege, carry internalized powerlessness. It is hard to work
          through that and impossible to just “strip it off”. We can start
          noticing it. For example, there are circle members who, in a round,
          will add preambles or postscripts to their contributions: <emphasis
          role="from-text">“well, I do not know, my ideas are always not as
          good as yours”</emphasis>, or <emphasis role="from-text">“yeah,
          that’s just what I think, this was probably not useful for
          you”</emphasis>. A combination of awareness, communication skills
          and practicing equivalence<indexterm>
              <primary>equivalence</primary>
            </indexterm> can do a lot. If we hear circle members making their
          own contribution small, we often speak up and let them know how we
          appreciate their contributions. That is probably not going to change
          their internalized patterns immediately but it might be a step
          toward awareness.</para>

          <para>The opposite is true as well. If we notice that someone is
          speaking with a sense of superiority, it might be useful to bring it
          up. Some people are not aware of it and might be grateful for that
          to be brought to their attention. In general, we find that most
          people <emphasis role="from-text">want</emphasis> to talk with a
          sense of equivalence but they lack the awareness or skills to do
          so.</para>

          <para>Sociocracy requires people to claim their power. Sociocracy
          does not address directly internalized experiences of privilege! A
          way to address that is by doing personal work on awareness of
          privilege and power. What sociocracy does is to provide space so
          everyone can speak as equals. Rounds are crucial here because rounds
          embody the sense of everyone’s voice mattering. As we get to know
          each other more, stereotypes and power-over/power-under patterns
          recede. (See “Power Under” in references on page <xref
          linkend="literature" xrefstyle="select: pagenumber"/>.)</para>

          <para>Anecdotally, sociocratic elections seem to run counter to the
          mainstream patterns at least to some extent. We have seen numerous
          elections where the person elected was not the typical leader – at
          least in comparison with majority vote.</para>

                willing to follow formats.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>We can be aware of these biases and try to work
          around them. For example, a good facilitator can summarize what
          someone has said to make sure the group can harvest the wisdom in
          it. Circle members may request<indexterm>
              <primary>request</primary>
            </indexterm> to go last in a round because it takes them a while
          to think something through. If we own and acknowledge these
          challenges, we can be allies to those who have a harder time
          expressing themselves and find creative solutions together. Another
          creative solution we have found. If there is someone who prefers
          having time to think before speaking, start a round by a minute of
          silence for everyone, and during that time everyone plans what they
          are going to say. Over a round of 6 people each speaking for 1-2
          minutes, we can easily save time by taking a minute for people to
          sort their thoughts.</para>

          <para>The last bias, the advantage of people who are able and
          willing to follow a format, we address with support, charts, posters
          on the wall and clear prompts. Rounds are useful to harvest people’s
          ideas and seem to neutralize (not marginalize) people whose
          contributions do not seem constructive. But if someone is “off” very
          often, it is hard to include their voice. There have been
          experiments with substitutes. For example, the actual circle member
          is not at the meeting but someone else takes their viewpoint and
          speaks for them. We know it can be done – but it takes quite some
          effort to do so.</para>

                    <secondary>department circle</secondary>

                people if a general circle member is selected leader of that
                general circle. With that many people in the room, it is hard
                to hear everyone because every round is long. It also becomes
                almost impossible for the general circle to attend to every

                <para>The antidote is awareness. Everyone in the organization
                has to embrace decision making power distributed out to the
                most specific level possible. One has to ask the question – is
                it that the general circle wants to hold onto power, or is it
                that work circles are shying away from power? One might have
                to train the circles on how to make policy. Depending on your
                context, there might be hesitancy to take full charge of
                policy. Once a group successfully unleashes the power in the
                most specific circles, they will notice the difference.</para>

            <secondary>not enough training</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>We have seen implementations struggle when only a small
          fraction of the people were trained. Only when everyone (or a
          significant fraction) feels empowered through understanding the
          governance structure, can we reach equality.</para>

          <para>Education has to be available over time (see section <xref
          linkend="continuing-education" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> for
          continuous education), and it has to include not only <emphasis
          role="from-text">how</emphasis> we do things but also <emphasis
          role="from-text">why</emphasis> we do things. People are busy doing
          their work, and it is the aim, not the governance method, that
          drives the work. They might not hold the information on the how and
          why of processes because it is not in their focus. That is why we
          explain “in the moment” and educate only on what is relevant to
          people. For example, the more the members of an organization know
          about <emphasis role="from-text">why</emphasis> we do elections the
          way we do them, the more likely they are to stick to a format. They
          will be more willing to teach it to each other. They will be more
          skilled in adapting processes to their context because they will
          know which pieces are important and why.</para>

          <para>If we fail on educating enough members on governance, this can
          lead into power struggles when the group falls into camps (those who
          know and those who do not) which can lead into those who do not feel
          comfortable in the process fighting the new governance system. We
          will then find ourselves in the same difficult situation of people
          questioning processes and slowing things down. It can cost an
          incredible amount of energy to be dealing with that kind of
          disruption.</para>

          <para>We sometimes observe a victim mentality around governance – as
          if one was constrained and “at the mercy” of the governance system.
          The governance system is <emphasis role="from-text">for</emphasis>
          the members, offering tools and options to harness the power we
          have.</para>

          <para>It has to be clear to people that processes are not there to
          constrain them but to <emphasis role="from-text">free</emphasis>
          them. Education has to be stating the positive: The reason for doing
          rounds is not to constrain people. We do rounds so we can support
          each other in speaking and listening. The language we use in
          explaining processes is extremely important because it can either
          support victim mentality (<emphasis role="from-text">“That’s how
          it’s done. Just accept it, it’s the rule.”</emphasis>) or empowering
          (<emphasis role="from-text">“This is a useful idea for us because it
          helps us…”</emphasis>).</para>

          one of our organizations.<informalexample>
              <para>I found a note in a room taken care of by a certain
              circle. The note was a complaint about something in the room.

              However, it is unclear whether this note will ever be seen by
              the circle that is in charge. The more effective way would have
              been to send an email to the circle leader.</para>
            </informalexample>This example shows how information about the
          governance system and how it works can either empower people or
          leave them voiceless. The voice of the person leaving the note
          cannot be heard as well as the person who knows the best way to
          contact decision-makers. Knowledge is power, once more.</para>

          <para>In new implementations, what happens here and there is that

          focusing on content, there is obsession with how to do things the
          “proper” way. The important thing to understand here is that if it
          is rigid, it is not sociocratic! The <emphasis

          is to ensure effectiveness<indexterm>
              <primary>effectiveness</primary>
            </indexterm> while making sure no one is ignored. The tools and

          until there is enough experience to experiment. Diverting from best
          practices when groups are inexperienced often leads to trouble that
          could have been avoided. On the other hand, it’s good to keep your
          eyes wide open right from the beginning – groups might have to tweak

            <title>“Disruptive” behavior’: feedback as superpower</title>

            <para>We have heard many times from struggling organizations that
            do not work effectively because there is this person who
            always…(fill in the blank). There is a standard question we ask in
            response: <emphasis role="from-text">“Have you told them about the
            impact this behavior has on you?”</emphasis> More often than not,
            people had not engaged in an honest conversation. How can we
            expect people to change without feedback? Feedback is the magic
            power we all have, and it can shift us from finger-pointing to
            stepping into responsibility. The world opens up when we get to a
            point where we realize that we have power in our world because we
            have the option of giving feedback. We are shifting from a fixed,
            blaming mindset (<emphasis role="from-text">“This is never going
            to work because of her.”</emphasis>) to a growth mindset:
            <emphasis role="from-text">“There is something I can
            do.”</emphasis></para>

            <para>This cannot be said enough: everyone has to give feedback
            about what is going on. The vast majority of struggles can be
            dealt with. It is silence and sometimes willful looking the other
            way that keeps organizations from moving forward. We are aware
            that some people might not change, even with kind and specific
            feedback. Still, feedback can provide a lot of opportunities for
            positive change.</para>

              </indexterm> of the organization or circle, they have to be
            removed. There will hopefully be a number of (defined) steps and a
            lot of feedback, one-on-ones and similar measures before that
            step. We can engage, be curious, be transparent and explicit about
            our own needs and the other people’s impact on us.</para>

            every year might be another approach. Another idea is to attach it
            to elections. When someone (or you) is selected to fill a role,
            request<indexterm>
                <primary>request</primary>
              </indexterm> that a performance review be done half-way through

            facilitator but I am also wondering whether my style works for

            term, we do a quick round where we talk about how my facilitation
            is working for me and for you? That would give me enough time to
            learn on the job and you some time to experience me in this role.

          <para>Circles have to find the “just-right” level of information to
          be transparent. If people are overwhelmed by information, they will
          not even read the most important email anymore. If your office
          kitchen is full of signs and reminders, people will likely not read
          them all. If we send out requests for feedback too rarely, we might
          be missing out on good information. It is always a balance.</para>

          <para>We also have to find a mix that works with regard to the
          channel and frequency we use to spread information. Do we send out
          emails, make announcements in meetings, invite public hearings, a
          newsletter, social media, posters, a file system? Do we invite
          feedback by direct contact, online surveys, paper etc? Most people
          have experienced that the just right level of information depends on
          the context, it depends on what people are used to, how tight-knit
          the community is, and many other factors. It seems important to use
          more than one channel. Some people respond to emails, some people
          tend to read signs. What works well is to put information as close
          as possible to the situation we are regulating. The circle made a
          policy about how to use the community garden hose? Laminate a short
          version and hang it next to the garden hose. The circle made a
          policy on how to clean up after renting a room? Include the policy
          (short and in understandable language) in every rental confirmation
          email, or automatically send it out to people on the day they are
          renting. If people tend to use too much dishwasher detergent, put a
          spoon into the detergent that has the capacity of detergent you want
          people to use. If you want people to use unscented detergent in the
          laundry machines, a sign on a door might be ignored – it might be
          good feedback to put the sign right where the detergent goes.
          Information is not enough, one needs to say it in the right way,
          with the right timing and location. It helps to be a little creative
          here.</para>

          <para>The most important thought to remember: As the policy-maker in
          that <indexterm>
              <primary>domain</primary>
            </indexterm>domain, your priority is to be helpful. Do not operate
          from <emphasis role="from-text">“well, I am right because we made
          the policy, and you are wrong because you did not follow
          it.”</emphasis> If people are not being accountable, we can try to
          think what we can do as a circle so that it will be easier for
          others to be accountable. Think of the users of your domain as your
          customers, even if they are your co-workers, family members or
          neighbors.</para>

          <para>One can also gamify it – making it fun to follow a policy.
          There is a famous example of public toilets and with stickers in the
          shape of flies that opened my eyes to this aspect of accountability.
          It was observed that men peeing miss the toilet – sitting in
          resentment and righteousness did not change anything. There was a
          brilliant experiment of putting little stickers in the shape of a
          fly into the toilets, visible for everyone peeing while standing up.
          People were playful and had the urge to pee on the fly. The
          side-effect of aiming better was less clean-up. Those stickers were
          much more effective than any sign or system of punishment.</para>

          <para>A very helpful change we made in our own community was to
          offer the full minutes<indexterm>
              <primary>minutes (meeting minutes)</primary>
            </indexterm> of a circle meeting in our online logbook<indexterm>
              <primary>logbook</primary>
            </indexterm>, and to only send out a brief email containing the
          circle name, members, date, and a summary of decisions with a link
          to full minutes. Everyone can skim a user-friendly 6-line email.
          Most people trust the other circles, so as long as nothing
          unexpected happens, all is good and easy. If there is a new policy
          and a circle is expecting some reactions, they will put a draft into
          the minutes and direct people’s attention to it.</para>

          <para>It is the people’s job to take information in, but it is your
          responsibility as a circle to get information out in a way that can
          be taken in.</para>

              <secondary>parent circle</secondary>
            </indexterm> is to take care of their sub-circles. Calling it
          “parent” circle is completely on point here! The child-circle
          reports to the parent circle, but the parent circle has to listen
          and reach out. When the child circle stops reporting because the
          circle fell apart, the parent circle has to notice.</para>

          <para>A very simple system to support circle care is to keep a list
          of sub-circles and to check on them at least every other meeting.
          This can be a quick “all is well”, or it can be longer, depending on
          your context. Ideally, we will have the leader and the delegate of
          every child circle present, so there should always be someone
          present to give a status report. If the child circle falls apart,
          all responsibility falls back on the parent circle. (For example,
          the parent circle could then appoint a new leader.)</para>

          <para><informalexample>
              <para>SoFA supported an organization with geographic circles
              nationwide in the US. Local groups were connected, forming

            <primary>circle meeting</primary>

            <secondary>too many meetings</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>Another typical pitfall is starting an organization with too
          many circles (and too many meetings). The organization has to be
          developed according to the work that needs to be done (and the
          people available to do that work), not around wishful thinking. The
          danger is that we stretch ourselves too thin. We can only populate
          as many circles as we can populate. Work circles are formed to focus
          our attention to a certain <indexterm>
              <primary>domain</primary>
            </indexterm>domain, so the equation has to include (1) the number
          of people to do the work (2) the amount of work to do.</para>

          <para>Instead of starting a new circle, we can define an
          operational<indexterm>
              <primary>role</primary>

              <secondary>operational role</secondary>
            </indexterm> role (see section <xref linkend="operationalroles"
          xrefstyle="select: labelnumber page"/>) and leave policy-making in
          the circle. Operations<indexterm>
              <primary>operations</primary>
            </indexterm> can be taken care of by one or two (pair) members.
          That way, work and attention are taken off the plate for the circle,
          but there is no new circle to be sustained. That also reduces the
          time spent in meetings.</para>

          <para>Another misconception is that every meeting has to happen with
          all circle members every time. This is certainly true for policy
          meetings but not for for operational meetings<indexterm>
              <primary>operational meeting</primary>
            </indexterm>. Often, delegates do not need to attend operational
          meetings. Policy requires the whole circle’s consent. We can work
          with subsets of that group for other meetings, whenever it makes
          sense. Form helping circles<indexterm>
              <primary>helping circle</primary>
            </indexterm> with only part of the circle as often as possible to
          reduce the amount of time everyone has to sit through a
          meeting.</para>

          <para>Also, the circle decides how often policy meetings are.
          Nothing is set in stone – it is helpful to be on a regular schedule
          because it is easier to track but meetings don’t have to happen with
          the same frequency all the time. One circle might meet weekly,
          another one monthly, another one monthly in summer and twice a month
          in winter. Whatever makes sense in a context will guide our
          decision.</para>

        <para>If we are about to join a sociocratic organization, there might

        through to become a member.</para>

        <para>If an organization expects new members to just be trained on the
        fly, they might be in for an unpleasant surprise. Imagine only half of
        the members being trained well enough to be active promoters of the
        governance system (after all, we join an organization because of its
        mission or aim, not because of its governance method). If the
        membership increases by 50%, the people who are trained and active
        supporters will only be a third of the members. Some circles may even
        wind up without any members well-trained in sociocracy. They will
        probably just ‘‘go and do’’ instead of asking for training because
        they might not be aware that sociocratic self-governance<indexterm>

      <para>Sometimes we can feel it when the insight sinks in for people. It
      tends to happen when training participants experience the sociocratic
      circle structure with their own bodies, standing in linked circles. They
      experience how sociocracy embodies interdependence. How it ensures
      transparency. How no one can be overpowered anymore. How sociocracy
      requires self-responsibility. Some training participants get silent,
      while their minds and hearts are taking in what they see and feel.
      Sometimes they say things like <emphasis role="from-text">“ …but
      …that’s…big”</emphasis> – expressing how deep and how wonderful of a
      change sociocracy would mean to their company, their community or their
      volunteer organization. They become filled with hope and excitement. A
      few get tense or sad, as they lack confidence that their own
      organization might ever embrace a system like sociocracy.</para>

      <para>We all have had our share of experiencing oppression. Our
      extractive and divisive system hurts everyone. That’s why, in sociocracy
      training, there is never just practice. The power structures that are
      out there in the world are ingrained in us and therefore they are always
      in the room, very close to the surface, and with it our pain, sadness,
      fear, hope and longing.</para>

      <para>Sociocracy is not a superficial tool to make workers <emphasis
      role="from-text">feel</emphasis> like they have more power so they
      gladly put in more effort into a system built on power-over. It’s not
      another management method. It’s deep change. It’s real. To us,
      sociocracy is a tool so powerful it can be the operating system for a
      new paradigm and economy: based on connection, consideration and care.
      In boardrooms and in living rooms. In classrooms and in community
      buildings. Our vision is a world outside of the paradigm of right and
      wrong, winners and losers. All of us know that a more beautiful world is
      possible, we feel it and we long for it. We are equipped with what it
      takes to live it. AND we need to create an environment that brings out
      those strengths. Systems that allow us to work <emphasis
      role="from-text">from</emphasis> the longing for connection instead of
      stuffing it. Systems that are built on trust, instead of systems that
      reward divisiveness and ridicule or outlaw consideration.</para>

      <para>Pretty words won’t make it happen. Good intentions won’t be
      enough, and neither will awareness or individual action. Taking on a
      system ingrained in mainstream culture requires more than that. More
      people need to know that there are options. More people need to have
      access to skills and information about those options. People who already
      know about the tools and use them need to find each other so we can be
      companions for each other. To troubleshoot together and to celebrate
      together. Since there are still so few of us, we need each other so we
      can be support if one or some of us struggle and deals with
      disappointing setbacks. Culture change requires places where we can
      recharge our batteries.</para>

      <para>In Gandhi’s model for social change, we need political action
      (intervening where there is injustice), personal transformation, and a
      constructive program. We see sociocracy in the constructive program,
      showing what the alternative for governance could look like. A good
      model and relevant skills. That’s the area that we’re most invested in.
      Superficial sociocracy won’t change culture. Talking about it won’t. The
      revolution needs skills in a lot of people so the new paradigm can be a
      lived reality everywhere. The ultimate goal will be to put trainers out
      of business – because every child learns how to listen, speak and
      collaborate. Until sociocracy is the new normal there will be need for
      learners to build the skills and experience it takes to use sociocracy
      in the real world.</para>

      <para>That’s where SoFA comes in. SoFA was founded in 2016 by the
      authors of this book, after years of previous experience with
      sociocracy, with the mission of spreading sociocracy widely so everyone

      current circle structure is shown in <xref linkend="SoFAcircles"

        <title>Ted</title>

        <para>I was born in 1979 and raised in Germany with German and British
        parents and 3 siblings. I studied linguistics, literature and history,
        in Tübingen and Bologna, graduating with the counterpart of a PhD in
        linguistics for work on syntax and semantics.</para>

        <para>What does linguistics have to do with sociocracy? Linguistics
        studies how the human mind works. Language and communication are
        humbling and complex – and still we are able to form sentences no one
        has ever formed before us. For linguists, it takes considerable effort
        to understand something that our mind seems to do so effortlessly. It
        is intriguing to think of group decision-making as an extension of
        language processing and how we can think together. How can we practice
        mutual understanding and shared decision-making so that it feels just
        as effortless?</para>

        <para>To me, there is a social mission in linguistics. Linguistics is
        not grammar-police: linguistics studies how people speak, not how
        <emphasis role="from-text">some</emphasis> people <emphasis
        role="from-text">think</emphasis> they should speak. Everyone’s voice
        matters – and anything we say is always a perfect expression of the
        human mind. My mind loves concepts, and even more I love switching
        back and forth from concrete examples to the level of concepts, and
        back again.</para>

        <para>I moved into a cohousing community in 2012 as this community had
        just adopted sociocracy (they refer to it as Dynamic Governance). I
        soon became interested and involved. It was sociocracy that brought
        Jerry and me together, and together we founded <emphasis
        role="from-text">Sociocracy For All</emphasis> (SoFA). Within SoFA, I
        currently hold several roles, mostly around content production, tech
        and networking.</para>

        <para>The cohousing community is home to my children, Helena, Sophia,
        Antonia, Julia and Emilia. They grow up knowing their 70 neighbors and
        being known and loved by them. Although not all of my children can
        even pronounce the word <emphasis
        role="from-text">sociocracy</emphasis>, every dinner conversation
        involves at least one round of highlights and lowlights from their
        day.</para>
      </section>

        <title>Jerry</title>

        <para>Love is the only resource without limit, endlessly renewable.
        Yet so many experience shortages. It is like water. There is plenty of
        it. But there are distribution problems. And there are contamination
        problems. The sadness that human beings are more clever than they are
        wise. We do have answers to all our problems. Except we have not yet
        figured out how to work together consistently and effectively. That is
        what has attracted me to sociocracy and Non-Violent
        Communication.</para>

        <para>I was born in Cuba and moved with my family to New York City in
        1961 when I was 8 years old. From my parents, I got the love of nature
        and love of mind. What I learned outside the classroom as a young
        adult was that there was hope that we could model community living in
        a way that demonstrated healthy relationships with other humans and
        the land. What most influenced me was my 12-year involvement with
        Movement for a New Society (MNS). We were a network of small groups
        dedicated to revolutionary nonviolence, which meant seeking to help
        build a just and joyful world through direct action to challenge
        whatever systems were generating pain, through training activists in
        all the skills needed, and through valuing the sense of community in
        how we lived.</para>

        <para>The reality of trying to live these ideals is humbling. What I
        can say for myself is that I am still trying. And the gift has been
        the sharing of this journey with the principal author of this book,
        Ted, and the amazing energy and capacity Ted has brought into creating
        <emphasis role="from-text">Sociocracy For All</emphasis>. The gift is
        also now being part of the world-wide weaving of so many threads
        seeking to live the understanding that all people are one and that
        everyone’s needs matter.</para>

          falls into three steps (lead-do-measure). We also added the framing
          statements for each part as they would sound like in natural
          language.</para>
